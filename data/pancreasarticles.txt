Label=""EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":To generate spatially-resolved tumor and immune cell data at single cell resolution, we developed two quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence assays to interrogate myeloid cells (CD15, CD14, ARG1, CD33, HLA-DR) and macrophages [CD68, CD163, CD86, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), MRC1 (CD206)] in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Spatial point pattern analyses were conducted to assess the degree of co-localization between tumor cells and immune cells. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations with patient outcomes.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In a multi-institutional cohort of 305 primary PDAC resection specimens, myeloid cells were abundant, enriched within stromal regions, highly heterogeneous across tumors, and differed by somatic genotype. High densities of CD15+ARG1+ immunosuppressive granulocytic cells and M2-polarized macrophages were associated with worse patient survival. Moreover, beyond cell density, closer proximity of M2-polarized macrophages to tumor cells was strongly associated with disease-free survival, revealing the clinical significance and biologic importance of immune cell localization within tumor areas.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":A diverse set of myeloid cells are present within the PDAC tumor microenvironment and are distributed heterogeneously across patient tumors. Not only the densities but also the spatial locations of myeloid immune cells are associated with patient outcomes, highlighting the potential role of spatially-resolved myeloid cell subtypes as quantitative biomarkers for PDAC prognosis and therapy.",eng,Clin Cancer Res,9502500,1078-0432,aheadofprint,33262135,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3141,NA,NA,Clin Cancer Res

This allows the study of digestive processes and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. However, detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure, perioperative management, a determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are scarce in the literature. Data of the long-term health status of minipigs upon EPI induction are still not available. Therefore, the present study describes in detail an experimental approach to the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency via pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs and the long term follow up of the animal's health state.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":14 Goettingen minipigs underwent pancreatic duct ligation via midline laparotomy for the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal fat content, fat absorption, chymotrypsin levels, body weight and blood vitamin and glucose levels were determined.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was successfully induced in 12 Goettingen minipigs. Two minipigs failed to develop exocrine insufficiency most likely due to undetected accessory pancreatic ducts. All animals tolerated the procedure very well and gained weight within 8 weeks after surgery without requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The follow up for approx. 180 weeks showed a stable body weight and health state of the animals with normal blood glucose levels (Table 1). From approx. 130 weeks post pancreatic duct ligation, all animals were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes and vitamins resulting in blood concentrations almost within the reference range.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs is an excellent method of inducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is important to identify and ligate accessory pancreatic ducts since persistence of accessory ducts will lead to maintenance of exocrine pancreatic function. The EPI model caused no persistent side effects in the animals and has the potential to be used in long-term EPI studies with up to 100 weeks post-OP without supplementation with enzymes and vitamins.",eng,BMC Gastroenterol,100968547,1471-230X,epublish,33256637,10.1186/s12876-020-01541-3,20,1,BMC Gastroenterol

Although, a primary respiratory pathogen, over the ensuing period, its extra-pulmonary effects have come to the forefront. The virus, having multi-organ tropism, has been shown to affect a host of other organs beyond the lung, including the pancreas. The data on pancreatic involvement by COVID-19, however, have been limited. Moreover, whether the effects on the pancreas are due to the direct effects of the virus or is just an epi-phenomenon is debatable. The prevalence of pancreatic injury and degree of injury are the other issues that need to be addressed. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and the management of the same in the COVID era needs to be tailored assessing the risk-benefit ratio for the same. Additionally, pancreatic surgery increases not only the morbidity of the patient, but also the risk of the operator and burden on the health care system. Hence, the decision for such major procedures needs to be rationalized for optimum benefit during this pandemic.

However, this operation is complex, and the peri-operative risk is high, making patients more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, establishing a risk model that predicts admission to ICU is meaningful in preventing patients from post-operation deterioration and potentially reducing socio-economic burden.

The features, such as age, duration of operation, monocyte count, and intra-operative partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), are risk factors in the ICU admission. The protective factors include RBC count, analgesic pump dexmedetomidine (DEX), and intra-operative maintenance of DEX. Basophil percentage, duration of the operation, and total infusion volume were risk variables for staying in ICU. The bilirubin, CA125, and pre-operative albumin were associated with the post-operative bleeding volume.

The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Due to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT, and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. 118 resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were selected from the cases between 2011-2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes. There were statistically significant differences for dystrophic calcification, eosinophilic tumor cell changes, elastotic stromal/vascular change, islet cell hyperplasia, and nerve hypertrophy between the two groups, with these features seen more frequently in NAT cases. Blue/grey stromal fibrosis was present in all cases regardless of NAT, except few complete regression cases and one treated case with intraneural invasion only. Blue/grey fibrosis is a useful histologic visual clue to suggest the possibility of adjacent tumor in the majority of PDAC cases regardless of NAT. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, neither grading scheme correlated with overall survival in our cohort.

Within this cohort of high-quality hospitals, thirty-day total episode, index hospitalization, physician, postacute care, and readmission spending was analyzed. Logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the probability of postoperative outcomes and post-discharge resource utilization.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":43,007 Medicare patients underwent either pancreas, esophageal, lung, rectal, or colon resection for cancer at a hospital within the highest-quality quintile. Among the highest quality hospitals, total episode spending ranged from $18,712 for colectomy to $38,054 for esophagectomy. Spending between the lowest- and highest spending hospitals varied from $1,207 (CI95% $1,195 to $1,220) or 6.6% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for colectomy to $5,706 (CI95% $5,506 to $5,906) or 16.1% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for esophagectomy. The largest component of variation was from postacute care spending followed by readmission. For all operations the risk-adjusted rate of postacute care facility utilization was lower among the lowest spending hospitals compared to the highest spending hospitals. For example, for pancreas the lowest-spending hospitals on average discharged patients to a postacute care facility at a rate of 18,6% (CI95% 16.2 to 20.9) compared to 31.0% (CI95% 28.2 to 33.9) in the highest-spending hospitals.

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody specific for tumor necrosis factor α that has already been approved for the treatment of several autoimmune conditions in adults and children. Whether golimumab could preserve beta-cell function in youth with newly diagnosed overt (stage 3) type 1 diabetes is unknown.                 Label=""METHODS"":In this phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, children and young adults (age range, 6 to 21 years) with newly diagnosed overt type 1 diabetes to receive subcutaneous golimumab or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was endogenous insulin production, as assessed according to the area under the concentration-time curve for C-peptide level in response to a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (4-hour C-peptide AUC) at week 52. Secondary and additional end points included insulin use, the glycated hemoglobin level, the number of hypoglycemic events, the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide over time, and response profile.                 Label=""RESULTS"":A total of 84 participants underwent randomization - 56 were assigned to the golimumab group and 28 to the placebo group. The mean (±SD) 4-hour C-peptide AUC at week 52 differed significantly between the golimumab group and the placebo group (0.64±0.42 pmol per milliliter vs. 0.43±0.39 pmol per milliliter, P&lt;0.001). A treat-to-target approach led to good glycemic control in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the groups in glycated hemoglobin level. Insulin use was lower with golimumab than with placebo. A partial-remission response (defined as an insulin dose-adjusted glycated hemoglobin level score [calculated as the glycated hemoglobin level plus 4 times the insulin dose] of ≤9) was observed in 43% of participants in the golimumab group and in 7% of those in the placebo group (difference, 36 percentage points; 95% CI, 22 to 55). The mean number of hypoglycemic events did not differ between the trial groups. Hypoglycemic events that were recorded as adverse events at the discretion of investigators were reported in 13 participants (23%) in the golimumab group and in 2 (7%) of those in the placebo group. Antibodies to golimumab were detected in 30 participants who received the drug; 29 had antibody titers lower than 1:1000, of whom 12 had positive results for neutralizing antibodies.

Current oncologic PDAC therapies confer marginal benefit and, thus, a significant unmet clinical need exists for new therapeutic strategies. To identify effective PDAC therapies, we leveraged a syngeneic orthotopic PDAC transplant mouse model to perform a large-scale, in vivo screen of 16 single-agent and 41 two-drug targeted therapy combinations in mice. Among 57 drug conditions screened, combined inhibition of heat shock protein (Hsp)-90 and MEK was found to produce robust suppression of tumor growth, leading to an 80% increase in the survival of PDAC-bearing mice with no significant toxicity. Mechanistically, we observed that single-agent MEK inhibition led to compensatory activation of resistance pathways, including components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, which was overcome with the addition of HSP90 inhibition. The combination of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) was also active in vitro in established human PDAC cell lines and in vivo in patient-derived organoid PDAC transplant models.

Gastroenterology &amp; hepatology,The overlap between irritable bowel syndrome and organic gastrointestinal diseases.,10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30212-0,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habit. This condition is one of the most frequent reasons to seek a gastroenterology consultation in primary and secondary care. The diagnosis of IBS is made by identifying characteristic symptoms, as defined by the Rome criteria, and excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases that might otherwise explain these symptoms. Organic conditions that can be mistaken for IBS include coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and, in those with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms, chronic gastrointestinal infections, microscopic colitis, and primary bile acid diarrhoea. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth being associated with IBS is shrouded with controversy and uncertainty, mainly because of invalid tests due to poor sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions. There is insufficient evidence to link IBS-type symptoms with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, since both are hampered by conflicting data. Finally, there is growing appreciation that IBS can present in patients with known but stable organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as quiescent IBD or coeliac disease. Recognising functional gut symptoms in these individuals is paramount so that potentially harmful escalations in immunosuppressive therapy can be avoided and attention can be focused on addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction.

Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD-NECs) have a relatively high Ki67 index, &gt;20% in all cases and commonly exceeding 50%. After anecdotally observing PD-NECs with an unexpectedly low and heterogeneous Ki67 index following chemotherapy in 5 cases, we identified 15 additional cases of treated high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (HG-NENs). The study cohort comprised 20 cases; 11 PD-NECs, 8 mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 WD-NET, G3 from various anatomic sites (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and breast). The Ki67 index was evaluated on pretreatment (when available) and posttreatment samples. Topographic heterogeneity in the Ki67 index was expressed using a semi-quantitative score of 0 (no heterogeneity) to 5 (&gt;80% difference between maximal Ki67 and minimal Ki67 indices). Relative to the pretreatment group (n=9, mean Ki67 of 86.3%, range 80% to 100%), the neoplasms in the posttreatment group (n=20, mean Ki67 of 47.7%, range 1% to 90%) showed a significantly lower Ki67 index (18/20 cases). Of the 18 cases with a relatively low Ki67 index, 15 showed heterogeneous labeling (mean heterogeneity score of 2.3, range 1 to 5) and in 3 cases it was a homogeneously low. This phenomenon was observed in all subtypes of HG-NENs. In 6 cases, the alterations in Ki67 index following treatment were sufficient to place these HG-NENs in the WHO G1 or G2 grade, erroneously suggesting a diagnosis of WD-NET, and in 9 cases there was sufficient heterogeneity in the Ki67 index to suggest that a limited biopsy may sample an area of low Ki67, even though hotspot regions with a Ki67 index of &gt;20% persisted. In 7 cases, the alterations in the Ki67 index were accompanied by morphologic features resembling a WD-NET. These observations suggest that there is a potential for misinterpretation of previously treated PD-NECs as WD-NETs, or for assigning a lower grade in G3 WD-NETs.

We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet.

Inhibiting CXCR4 in an experimental cancer medicine study by 1-wk continuous infusion of the small-molecule inhibitor AMD3100 (plerixafor) induces an integrated immune response that is detected by transcriptional analysis of paired biopsies of metastases from patients with microsatellite stable colorectal and pancreatic cancer. This integrated immune response occurs in three other examples of immune-mediated damage to noninfected tissues: Rejecting renal allografts, melanomas clinically responding to anti-PD1 antibody therapy, and microsatellite instable colorectal cancers.

The adaptor protein APPL1 promotes first-phase GSIS by up-regulating soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein expression. However, whether APPL2 (a close homology of APPL1 with the same domain organization) plays a role in β-cell functions is unknown. Here, we show that APPL2 enhances GSIS by promoting F-actin remodeling via the small GTPase Rac1 in pancreatic β-cells. β-cell specific abrogation of APPL2 impaired GSIS, leading to glucose intolerance in mice. APPL2 deficiency largely abolished glucose-induced first- and second-phase insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Real-time live-cell imaging and phalloidin staining revealed that APPL2 deficiency abolished glucose-induced F-actin depolymerization in pancreatic islets. Likewise, knockdown of APPL2 expression impaired glucose-stimulated F-actin depolymerization and subsequent insulin secretion in INS-1E cells, which were attributable to the impairment of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation. Treatment with the F-actin depolymerization chemical compounds or overexpression of gelsolin (a F-actin remodeling protein) rescued APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS. In addition, APPL2 interacted with Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RacGAP1) in a glucose-dependent manner via the bin/amphiphysin/rvs-pleckstrin homology (BAR-PH) domain of APPL2 in INS-1E cells and HEK293 cells. Concomitant knockdown of RacGAP1 expression reverted APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS, F-actin remodeling, and Rac1 activation in INS-1E cells. Our data indicate that APPL2 interacts with RacGAP1 and suppresses its negative action on Rac1 activity and F-actin depolymerization thereby enhancing GSIS in pancreatic β-cells.",eng,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,7505876,0027-8424,ppublish,33122440,10.1073/pnas.2016997117,117,45,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

Therefore, nearly, all solid tumors have a heterogeneous fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, which consists of myofibroblastic cells, extracellular matrix components, and infiltrates from various types of immune cell. In particular, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a prototype of a tumor with a pronounced inflammatory microenvironment, in which the majority of the tumor mass consists of nonneoplastic stromal and immune cells. Our own data and data from the literature indicate a protective role of tumor-infiltrating T cells for the host. On the other hand, we were able to show that a defined T cell subpopulation paradoxically promotes the progression of the tumor.

Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":Since in the literature, a debate between cytology and histology supporters is still ongoing and the trend is changing in favor of FNB, we would like to present our experience about the diagnostic yield of FNA and FNB. The aim of our study is to highlight FNA versus FNB diagnostic role of biliopancreatic lesions, highlight advantages, and drawbacks of these procedures, and our view on these 2 procedures and whether they should still be considered complementary or opposing techniques.

Our experience confirmed that FNA is extremely efficient in the diagnosis of biliopancreatic lesions, especially in the hands of expert endoscopists and pathologists. Considering anatomic location, EUS-FNA is more accurate for mass-forming neoplasms in the pancreatic parenchyma rather than for lesions of the biliary system. Moreover, concomitant FNB usually confirmed the cytological diagnosis, allowing a deeper immunohistochemical characterization of the neoplasia.

Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and lack of curative treatment modalities, the 5-y survival rate of PDAC patients is one of the lowest of any cancer type. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted. Therefore, identification of effective drug combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify gene targets whose inhibition creates synergistic tumor growth inhibition with gemcitabine (Gem), a first- or second-line chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as an effective druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition indicate that loss of PRMT5 activity synergistically enhances Gem cytotoxicity due to the accumulation of excessive DNA damage. At the molecular level, we show that inhibition of PRMT5 results in RPA depletion and impaired homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) activity. The combination (Gem + PRMT5 inhibition) creates conditional lethality and synergistic reduction of PDAC tumors in vivo.

Previous studies demonstrate that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is critical for nab-paclitaxel uptake into tumors and correlates with response. Gemcitabine increases nab-paclitaxel uptake by increasing Cav-1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with gemcitabine would further enhance the sensitivity of PDAC to nab-paclitaxel by increasing Cav-1 expression and nab-paclitaxel uptake.                 Label=""EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We investigated the sensitivity of different gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment regimens in a panel of PDAC cell lines and orthotopic xenograft models. The sensitivity of different treatment regimens was compared to the standard concurrent treatment.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Pre-treatment with gemcitabine before nab-paclitaxel increased Cav-1 and albumin uptake and significantly decreased proliferation and clonogenicity compared to concurrent treatment, which correlated with increased levels of apoptosis. Cav-1 silencing reduced the uptake of albumin and therapeutic advantage observed when cells were pre-treated with gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel. Additionally, we observed that pre-treatment with gemcitabine resulted in partial synchronization of cells in the G2/M phase at the time of nab-paclitaxel treatment, providing another mechanism for the benefit of altered scheduling. In heterotopic and orthotopic xenograft models, the altered schedule of gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel significantly delayed tumor growth compared to concurrent delivery without added toxicity.

The majority of these lesions are benign but some progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is a dearth of mouse models of these conditions. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 regulates development, differentiation, and inflammation. Germline Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes mice to the oncogenic effects of mutant Kras in the pancreas. Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras (KPN+/- ), leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high-grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6, but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2, and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC. These results highlight that the effects of loss of one Nr5a2 allele are time- and cell context-dependent. KPN+/- mice represent a new model to study the formation of cystic pancreatic lesions and their relationship with PanINs and classical PDAC.

Two of these were identified in 1750 consecutive cholecystectomies reviewed specifically for this purpose, placing its incidence at 0.1%. Median age was 68 years. Unlike other gallbladder lesions, these were slightly more common in men (female/male=0.8), and 55% had documented cholelithiasis. All were characterized by a compact multilocular, demarcated, cystic lesion with papillary proliferations and mucinous epithelial lining. The lesions' architecture, distribution, location, and typical size were suggestive of evolution from an underlying adenomyomatous nodule. All had gastric/endocervical-like mucinous epithelium, but 5 also had a focal intestinal-like epithelium. Cytologic atypia was graded as 1 to 3 and defined as 1A: mucinous, without cytoarchitectural atypia (n=3), 1B: mild (n=7), 2: moderate (n=2), and 3: severe atypia (n=7, 3 of which also had invasive carcinoma, 16%). Background gallbladder mucosal involvement was absent in all but 2 cases, both of which had multifocal papillary mucosal nodules. In conclusion, these cases highlight a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, mural ICNs arising in adenomyomatous nodules, which, by essentially sparing the &quot;main&quot; mucosa, not displaying &quot;field-effect/defect&quot; phenomenon, and only rarely (16%) showing carcinomatous transformation, are analogous to pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.",eng,Am J Surg Pathol,7707904,0147-5185,ppublish,33060404,10.1097/PAS.0000000000001603,44,12,Am J Surg Pathol

There is an unmet need to develop strategies to detect PaCa at an early, operable stage and prevent its progression. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic PaCa precursors that comprise nearly 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally via cross-sectional imaging. Since IPMNs can progress from low- and moderate-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasion, the study of these lesions offers a prime opportunity to develop early detection and prevention strategies. Organoids are an ideal preclinical platform to study IPMNs, and the objective of the current investigation was to establish a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from IPMNs. IPMN tumors and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were successfully harvested from 15 patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic surgical resection at Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute (Tampa, FL) between May of 2017 and March of 2019. Organoid cultures were also generated from cryopreserved tissues. Organoid count and size were determined over time by both Image-Pro Premier 3D Version 9.1 digital platform and Matlab application of a Circular Hough Transform algorithm, and histologic and genomic characterization of a subset of the organoids was performed using immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing, respectively. The success rates for organoid generation from IPMN tumor and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were 81% and 87%, respectively. IPMN organoids derived from different epithelial subtypes showed different morphologies in vitro, and organoids recapitulated histologic and genomic characteristics of the parental IPMN tumor.

These limitations often result in delayed or failed diagnosis, which negatively impact patient management and outcomes. This study aimed to create an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to differentiate AIP from PDAC, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal pancreas (NP), with sufficient performance to analyse EUS video in real time.

The maximum length of the vertical line between the surface of the pancreas and the aorta (P-A length), previously reported as prognostic factor of POPF, was also measured. We investigated the correlations between these parameters and the incidence of POPF in LG and OG groups.

There was no significant difference in the median PLD between the patients with or without POPF in both LG and OG. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that PLH (odds ratio [OR] 4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-11.3, P = 0.004) and P-A length (OR 4.06, 95%CI 1.05-15.7, P = 0.042] were independent factors for predicting POPF in LG. However, intraoperative blood loss (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.05-6.18, P = 0.038) was extracted as an independent factor in OG.

Breast cancer can be categorized as estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive luminal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) types based on the expression of ER, PR, and HER2. Although GATA3 is the most widely used tumor marker at present to determine the breast origin, which has been shown to be an excellent marker for ER-positive and low-grade breast cancer, but it does not work well for TNBC with sensitivity as low as &lt;20% in metaplastic breast carcinoma. In the current study, through TCGA data mining we identified trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) as a specific gene for breast carcinoma across 31 solid tumor types. Moreover, high mRNA level of TRPS1 was found in all four subtypes of breast carcinoma including ER/PR-positive luminal A and B types, HER2-positive type, and basal-type/TNBC. We then analyzed TRPS1 expression in 479 cases of various types of breast cancer using immunochemistry staining, and found that TRPS1 and GATA3 had comparable positive expression in ER-positive (98% vs. 95%) and HER2-positive (87% vs. 88%) breast carcinomas. However, TRPS1 which was highly expressed in TNBC, was significantly higher than GATA3 expression in metaplastic (86% vs. 21%) and nonmetaplastic (86% vs. 51%) TNBC. In addition, TRPS1 expression was evaluated in 1234 cases of solid tumor from different organs. In contrast to the high expression of GATA3 in urothelial carcinoma, TRPS1 showed no or little expression in urothelial carcinomas or in other tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colon and gastric adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma.

Despite the high prevalence of Kras mutations in pancreatic cancer patients, murine models expressing the oncogenic mutant Kras (Krasmut) in mature pancreatic cells develop PDAC at a low frequency. Independent of cell of origin, a second genetic hit (loss of tumor suppressor TP53 or PTEN) is important for development of PDAC in mice. We hypothesized ectopic expression and elevated levels of oncogenic mutant Kras would promote PanIN arising in pancreatic ducts. To test our hypothesis, the significance of elevating levels of K-Ras and Ras activity has been explored by expression of a CAG driven LGSL-KrasG12V allele (cKras) in pancreatic ducts, which promotes ectopic Kras expression. We predicted expression of cKras in pancreatic ducts would generate neoplasia and PDAC. To test our hypothesis, we employed tamoxifen dependent CreERT2 mediated recombination. Hnf1b:CreERT2;KrasG12V (cKrasHnf1b/+) mice received 1 (Low), 5 (Mod) or 10 (High) mg per 20 g body weight to recombine cKras in low (cKrasLow), moderate (cKrasMod), and high (cKrasHigh) percentages of pancreatic ducts. Our histologic analysis revealed poorly differentiated aggressive tumors in cKrasHigh mice. cKrasMod mice had grades of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN), recapitulating early and advanced PanIN observed in human PDAC. Proteomics analysis revealed significant differences in PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways between wild type, cKrasLow, cKrasMod, and cKrasHigh mice. In conclusion, in this study, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in pancreatic ducts generates early and late PanIN as well as PDAC.

We previously found numerous somatic L1 insertions in paired normal and GI cancerous tissues. Here, using a modified method of single-cell analysis for somatic L1 insertions, we studied adenocarcinomas of colon, pancreas, and stomach, and found a variable number of somatic L1 insertions in tumors of the same type from patient to patient. We detected no somatic L1 insertions in single cells of 5 of 10 tumors studied. In three tumors, aneuploid cells were detected by FACS. In one pancreatic tumor, there were many more L1 insertions in aneuploid than in euploid tumor cells. In one gastric cancer, both aneuploid and euploid cells contained large numbers of likely clonal insertions. However, in a second gastric cancer with aneuploid cells, no somatic L1 insertions were found. We suggest that when the cellular environment is favorable to retrotransposition, aneuploidy predisposes tumor cells to L1 insertions, and retrotransposition may occur at the transition from euploidy to aneuploidy. Seventeen percent of insertions were also present in normal cells, similar to findings in genomic DNA from normal tissues of GI tumor patients. We provide evidence that: 1) The number of L1 insertions in tumors of the same type is highly variable, 2) most somatic L1 insertions in GI cancer tissues are absent from normal tissues, and 3) under certain conditions, somatic L1 retrotransposition exhibits a propensity for occurring in aneuploid cells.",eng,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,7505876,0027-8424,aheadofprint,33277430,10.1073/pnas.2019450117,NA,NA,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

Nodose neurons responded in vivo to chemogenetic stimulation of β-cells and to pancreas infusion with serotonin, but were not sensitive to insulin. Responses to chemogenetic and pharmacologic stimulation of β-cells were blocked by a 5HT3R antagonist and were enhanced by increasing serotonin levels in β-cells.

After anecdotally observing PD-NECs with an unexpectedly low and heterogeneous Ki67 index following chemotherapy in 5 cases, we identified 15 additional cases of treated high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (HG-NENs).

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Levels of CDH11 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in CAFs than in pancreatic cancer epithelial cells, human or mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines, or immune cells. KPC/Cdh11+/- and KPC/Cdh11-/- mice survived significantly longer than KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice. Markers of stromal activation entirely surrounded pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice and incompletely in KPC/Cdh11+/- and KPC/Cdh11-/- mice, whose lesions also contained fewer FOXP3+ cells in the tumor center. Compared with pancreatic tumors in KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice, tumors of KPC/Cdh11+/- mice had increased markers of antigen processing and presentation; more lymphocytes and associated cytokines; decreased extracellular matrix components; and reductions in markers and cytokines associated with immunosuppression. Administration of the PD1 antibody did not prolong survival of KPC mice with 0, 1, or 2 alleles of Cdh11. Gemcitabine extended survival only of KPC/Cdh11+/- and KPC/Cdh11-/- mice or reduced subcutaneous tumor growth in mT3 engrafted Cdh11+/+ mice given in combination with the CDH11 antibody. A small molecule inhibitor of CDH11 reduced growth of pre-established mT3 subcutaneous tumors only if T and B cells were present in mice.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Knockout or inhibition of CDH11, which is expressed by CAFs in the pancreatic tumor stroma, reduces growth of pancreatic tumors, increases their response to gemcitabine, and significantly extends survival of mice. CDH11 promotes immunosuppression and extracellular matrix deposition, and might be developed as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.",eng,Gastroenterology,0374630,0016-5085,aheadofprint,33307028,10.1053/j.gastro.2020.11.044,NA,NA,Gastroenterology

The current 2019 World Health Organization classification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms categorises them into three groups; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs)(grade 1 grade 2, grade 3), pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) based on the mitotic rate, Ki-67 index, morphological differentiation and/or co-existing tissue subtype. PanNETs are also classified into non-functional NET, insulinoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, ACTH-producing NET and serotonin producing NET based on hormone production and clinical manifestations. A portion of the cases were associated with genetic syndromes such as multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN 1), neurofibromatosis and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In view of the distinctive pathology and clinical behaviour of PanNENs, the current 8th AJCC/UICC staging system has separated prognostic staging grouping for PanNETs from the pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas or MiNENs. Pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas and MiNENs are staged according to the prognostic stage grouping for exocrine pancreatic carcinoma. The new stage grouping of PanNETs was validated to have survival curves separated between different prognostic groups.

Its mutation was commonly observed in gastrointestinal cancers, such as pancreatic cancer. The loss of SMAD4 on immunohistochemical staining is often used to suggest a pancreaticobiliary differentiation in evaluating a metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown origin. However, the function and molecular mechanism of SMAD4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development are largely unknown. Thus, we studied the correlation between SMAD4 mutations and clinico-molecular features in the patients with NSCLC. We reported the frequencies and prognostic values of SMAD4 mutations in a Chinese NSCLC cohort using next-generation sequencing. The NSCLC cases from several public databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas and others, were also used in this study to elucidate SMAD4-related molecular partners and mechanisms. Integrated bioinformatics analyses were conducted, such as analysis of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and survival analysis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tissues harboring SMAD4 mutations tended to show SMAD4 deficiency or loss, while SMAD4 expression was significantly reduced at all stages of NSCLC cases. We found that reduced SMAD4 expression was more frequent in the patients with poor disease-free survival and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. SMAD4 mutation was an independent risk factor for the survival of NSCLC patients. The expression of SMAD4 was associated with that of SMAD2. The GSEA showed that SMAD4 might promote NSCLC progression by regulating proliferation, adhesion, and immune response. In conclusion, these data suggest that SMAD4 mutation or loss as well as reduced expression can be used to identify the NSCLC patients with poor survival and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. SMAD4 may be a predictive marker or therapeutic target in NSCLC.

Its use in daily diagnostics would improve the prognostic stratification of patients. We performed a multicenter interobserver study to test various budding assessment methods for their reproducibility. Two serial sections of 50 resected, treatment-naïve PDACs were stained for Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and pancytokeratin. Tumor budding was scored by independent observers at five participating centers in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada. Pathologists assessed tumor budding on a digital platform comparing H&amp;E with pancytokeratin staining in 10 high-power fields (10HPF) and one HPF hotspot (1HPF). Additionally, tumor budding was assessed in one H&amp;E hotspot at × 20 magnification, as suggested by the International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC). Correlation coefficients for bud counts between centers ranged from r = 0.58648 to r = 0.78641 for H&amp;E and from r = 0.69288 to r = 0.81764 for pancytokeratin. The highest interobserver agreement across all centers was observed for pancytokeratin 10HPFs (ICC = 0.6). ICC values were 0.49, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.4 for H&amp;E in 1HPF hotspot, H&amp;E in 10HPFs, pancytokeratin in 1HPF, and H&amp;E in one hotspot at ×20, respectively (ITBCC method). This interobserver study reveals a range between moderately poor to moderate agreement levels between pathologists for the different tumor budding assessment methods in PDAC. Acceptable levels of agreement were reached with the pancytokeratin 10HPF method, which can thus be recommended for the assessment of tumor budding in PDAC resection specimens.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help in the distinction of these neoplasms, but a proportion is unclassifiable using recommended markers. Hence, additional markers useful for the typing of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms are needed. The reported frequencies of the different types of IPMNs in surgical series vary to some extent, and such data based on Danish patients are currently lacking. Besides, the role of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in these neoplasms has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of different types of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms in a Danish cohort. Furthermore, we aimed to examine the utility of CD117, CK17, CK20, MUC4, and villin as markers for their distinction, in addition to the recommended markers MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6 and CDX2, and to evaluate the frequency of MMR deficiency.

Cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer pathophysiology; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Hence, our goal was to determine the role of INISG2 in breast cancer. INSIG2 mRNA and protein expression was correlated to metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of INSIG2 inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Conversely, overexpression of INSIG2 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Knockdown of INSIG2 did not affect cell proliferation but resulted in altered metabolism in vitro and attenuated experimental metastasis in vivo. Analysis of breast cancer tissue microarrays revealed significantly higher INSIG2 protein expression in breast cancer tissues. INSIG2 protein expression was correlated to hormone receptor status, with significantly higher expression in patients with triple-negative and HER2- molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas, however, revealed significantly lower INSIG2 mRNA expression in triple-negative breast cancer patients. Higher INSIG2 mRNA expression was correlated to poor survival probability.

Minimally invasive pancreatic resections (MIPRs) have become a part of standard surgical practice worldwide over the last decade; however, in comparison with other surgical procedures, the implementation of minimally invasive approaches into clinical practice has been rather slow.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Overall, five RCTs on MIPR versus OPR have been published and seven RCTs are currently recruiting. For DP, the results of two RCTs were in favor of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) in terms of shorter hospital stay and less intraoperative blood loss, with comparable morbidity and mortality. Regarding PD, two RCTs showed similar advantages for MIPD. However, concerns were raised after the early termination of the third multicenter RCT on MIPD versus open PD due to higher complication-related mortality in the laparoscopic group and no clear other demonstrable advantages.

However, its roles and action mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. Here, we analyzed MAP2K4 and its downstream kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) using immunohistochemical staining and their prognostic significances using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in our PDAC cohort. Then, we validated MAP2K4/JNK/p38 mRNA levels and prognostic significances using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Finally, we evaluated the effects of MAP2K4 on the proliferation and invasion of PDAC cells. MAP2K4, JNK, and p38 proteins were expressed in 97.3 % (72/74), 95.6 % (65/68), and 88.6 % (62/70) of the samples, respectively, and their levels in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in normal ducts. MAP2K4 protein expression was lower in male patients (p = 0.028). In our PDAC cohort, advanced TNM stage, low MAP2K4, and high JNK protein levels were significant prognostic factors for poor overall survival (OS) based on a univariate survival analysis (p = 0.006, p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). N stage and MAP2K4 and JNK protein levels were independent prognostic factors for OS based on multivariate analysis. We then built a prognosis prediction nomogram combining the standard TNM staging system with MAP2K4 and JNK expression that had a Harrell's C-index of 0.645. The new prognosis prediction model effectively stratified the resected patients with PDAC, from both our cohort and TCGA database, into low- and high-risk groups. Finally, MAP2K4 overexpression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro. This study shows that reduced protein and mRNA levels of MAP2K4 found in PDAC patients, coupled to in vitro effects observed, support the tumor suppressor role of MAP2K4 in PDAC.

Knockdown of GSTM2 by siRNA elevated apoptosis and decreased viability of pancreatic cancer cells treated with gemcitabine. Moreover, in vivo experiments further showed that shRNA induced GSTM2 downregulation enhanced drug sensitivity of gemcitabine in orthotopic pancreatic tumor mice. We also found that GSTM2 levels were lower in tumor tissues than in non-tumor tissues and higher GSTM2 expression was significantly associated with longer overall survival. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GSTM2 expression is essential for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells undergoing gemcitabine treatment and leads to chemo resistance.

We hypothesized that a glycan biomarker for PDACs called sialylated tumor-related antigen (sTRA) could be used for this purpose.                 Label=""EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We tested for differences between PDACs classified by glycan expression in multiple systems: sets of cell lines, organoids, and isogenic cell lines; primary tumors; and blood plasma from human subjects.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The sTRA-expressing models tended to have stem-like gene expression and the capacity for mesenchymal differentiation, in contrast to the nonexpressing models. The sTRA cell lines also had significantly increased resistance to seven different chemotherapeutics commonly used against pancreatic cancer. Patients with primary tumors that were positive for a gene expression classifier for sTRA received no statistically significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, in contrast to those negative for the signature. In another cohort, based on direct measurements of sTRA in tissue microarrays, the patients who were high in sTRA again had no statistically significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

Previous studies demonstrate that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is critical for nab-paclitaxel uptake into tumors and correlates with response. Gemcitabine increases nab-paclitaxel uptake by increasing Cav-1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that pretreatment with gemcitabine would further enhance the sensitivity of PDAC to nab-paclitaxel by increasing Cav-1 expression and nab-paclitaxel uptake.                 Label=""EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We investigated the sensitivity of different gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment regimens in a panel of PDAC cell lines and orthotopic xenograft models. The sensitivity of different treatment regimens was compared with the standard concurrent treatment.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Pretreatment with gemcitabine before nab-paclitaxel increased Cav-1 and albumin uptake and significantly decreased proliferation and clonogenicity compared with concurrent treatment, which correlated with increased levels of apoptosis. Cav-1 silencing reduced the uptake of albumin, and therapeutic advantage was observed when cells were pretreated with gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel. In addition, we observed that pretreatment with gemcitabine resulted in partial synchronization of cells in the G2-M-phase at the time of nab-paclitaxel treatment, providing another mechanism for the benefit of altered scheduling. In heterotopic and orthotopic xenograft models, the altered schedule of gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel significantly delayed tumor growth compared with concurrent delivery without added toxicity.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and CTCs were also extracted. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to detect mutations of KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, TP53, GNAS, and BRAF Results: KRAS mutation was detected in UDCs and fibrosis while SMAD4, TP53 and GNAS were only seen in UDCs. Patients with TP53 mutation showed relatively worse overall survival (OS) (HR=3.596, 95%=0.855-15.130, P=0.081). Five patients available for CTCs data were all positive for CTCs and seven of 16 pCR patients were detected with ctDNA at surgery. We proposed a new concept of regression assessment combining genomic analysis of resected specimens and liquid biopsy data for PDAC, namely molecular complete response (mCR). Three of six mCR patients recurred as compared with six in fifteen non-mCR patients. Seven of 15 non-mCR patients died during follow-up while there was only one in six mCR patients.

It has long been debated whether biliary AP, about 30% to 50% of all cases, is induced by bile acids (BAs) when they reach the pancreas via reflux or via the systemic blood circulation.Besides their classical function in digestion, BAs have become an attractive research target because of their recently discovered property as signaling molecules. The underlying mechanisms of BAs have been investigated in various studies. Bile acids are internalized into acinar cells through specific G-protein-coupled BA receptor 1 and various transporters. They can further act via different receptors: the farnesoid X, ryanodine, and inositol triphosphate receptor. Bile acids induce a sustained Ca2+ influx from the endoplasmic reticulum and release of Ca2+ from acidic stores into the cytosol of acinar cells. The overload of intracellular Ca2+ results in mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent acinar cell necrosis. In addition, BAs have a biphasic effect on pancreatic ductal cells. A more detailed characterization of the mechanisms through which BAs contribute to the disease pathogenesis and severity will greatly improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and may allow for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies for gallstone-inducedAP.",eng,Pancreas,8608542,0885-3177,ppublish,33370017,10.1097/MPA.0000000000001706,50,1,Pancreas

We encountered simultaneous metastases to the brain and lung in a PDAC patient after curative surgery. Case presentation A 68-year-old man with PDAC in the tail of the pancreas underwent distal pancreato-splenectomy. He received gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months. Two months later, brain and lung metastases occurred simultaneously. Considering the systemic condition, the patient received gamma knife treatment and an Ommaya reservoir was inserted for drainage. The patient's condition gradually worsened and he received the best supportive care. To the best of our knowledge, only 28 cases in which brain metastases of PDAC were identified at the time of ante-mortem have been reported to date, including the present case. Notably, the percentage of simultaneous brain and lung metastases was higher (32%) in a series of reviewed cohorts. Thus, lung metastasis might be one of the risk factors for the development of brain metastasis in patients with PDAC. As a systemic disease, it can be inferred that neoplastic cells will develop brain metastasis via hematogenous dissemination beyond the blood-brain barrier, even if local recurrence is controlled. In our case, immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), mucin core protein 1 (MUC1), and MUC5AC in the resected primary PDAC.

Most panNENs are nonfunctional and present as advanced disease. However, systemic therapies provide modest benefits. Therefore, there is a need for predictive biomarkers to develop personalized treatment and to advance new drug development. The somatostatin receptors remain the only clinically established prognostic and predictive biomarkers in panNENs. Oncogenic drivers are at a very low frequency. Commonly mutated genes in panNENs include MEN1, chromatin remodeling genes (DAXX and ATRX), and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway genes. In contrast, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (panNECs), which carry a very poor prognosis, have distinctive mutations in certain genes (eg, RB1 and p53).

Here we evaluated TME prognostic risk in small intestinal adenocarcinomas based on histologic assessment of tumor budding at the peritumoral-invasive front (pTB) and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs). pTB and sTILs were analyzed in 230 surgically resected small intestinal adenocarcinomas, as recommended by the International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC) and the International TILs Working Group (ITWG). On the basis of high levels of pTB count (≥10) and sTIL density (≥20%), we combined pTB and sTIL to produce a collective TME-based prognostic risk index: low-risk (pTBLow/sTILHigh; n=39, 17.0%), intermediate-risk (pTBLow/sTILLow or pTBHigh/sTILHigh; n=99, 43.0%), and high-risk groups (pTBHigh/sTILLow; n=92, 40.0%). TME risk index provided better prognostic stratification than the individual pTB and sTIL (14.9 vs. 6.7 vs. 10.3). Tumors with higher TME prognostic risk were associated with an infiltrative growth pattern and nonintestinal immunophenotype (both P=0.001), pancreatic invasion (P=0.010), lymphovascular (P&lt;0.001) or perineural invasion (P=0.006), higher T-category (P&lt;0.001), N-category (P=0.004), and stage grouping (P=0.002), and KRAS mutation (P=0.008).

We previously found numerous somatic L1 insertions in paired normal and GI cancerous tissues. Here, using a modified method of single-cell analysis for somatic L1 insertions, we studied adenocarcinomas of colon, pancreas, and stomach, and found a variable number of somatic L1 insertions in tumors of the same type from patient to patient. We detected no somatic L1 insertions in single cells of 5 of 10 tumors studied. In three tumors, aneuploid cells were detected by FACS. In one pancreatic tumor, there were many more L1 insertions in aneuploid than in euploid tumor cells. In one gastric cancer, both aneuploid and euploid cells contained large numbers of likely clonal insertions. However, in a second gastric cancer with aneuploid cells, no somatic L1 insertions were found. We suggest that when the cellular environment is favorable to retrotransposition, aneuploidy predisposes tumor cells to L1 insertions, and retrotransposition may occur at the transition from euploidy to aneuploidy. Seventeen percent of insertions were also present in normal cells, similar to findings in genomic DNA from normal tissues of GI tumor patients. We provide evidence that: 1) The number of L1 insertions in tumors of the same type is highly variable, 2) most somatic L1 insertions in GI cancer tissues are absent from normal tissues, and 3) under certain conditions, somatic L1 retrotransposition exhibits a propensity for occurring in aneuploid cells.",eng,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,7505876,0027-8424,ppublish,33277430,10.1073/pnas.2019450117,117,51,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

A novel cystic phenotype suggests broader roles for NR5A2 in pancreatic cancer†.,10.1002/path.5619,"The prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains dismal. Multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated the nuclear receptor NR5A2 in modulating PDAC risk, but mechanisms for this association are not understood. NR5A2 is a transcription factor that maintains acinar cell identity, and heterozygous loss of Nr5a2 in mice accelerates oncogenic KRAS-driven formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a PDAC precursor derived from acinar cells. In a recent issue of The Journal of Pathology, Cobo et al. characterize a novel mouse model that uses Ptf1a:Cre to drive oncogenic Kras as well as heterozygous Nr5a2 inactivation. In addition to the expected PanIN lesions, these mice exhibited a surprising phenotype: large pancreatic cystic lesions which have not been previously reported. Comparing expression of oncogenic Kras and heterozygous Nr5a2 in various mouse models reveals several possible explanations for these cystic lesions. Importantly, these differences across mouse models suggest that NR5A2 may contribute to PDAC precursors in ways beyond its previously characterized acinar cell autonomous role. These observations highlight that pathways implicated by GWAS may have roles in unexpected cell types, and an understanding of these roles will be critical to guide new preventive and treatment strategies for PDAC.

In this report, we examined whether tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of CXCR2-ligands expressing PDAC cells are regulated in vivo by a host CXCR2-dependent mechanism.

Host Cxcr2 loss led to inhibition in microvessel density in PDAC tumors. Interestingly, an enhanced spontaneous and experimental liver metastasis was observed in Cxcr2-/- mice as compared to WT mice. Increased metastasis in Cxcr2-/- mice was associated with an increase in extramedullary hematopoiesis and expansion of neutrophils and immature myeloid precursor cells in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice.

Postoperative pancreatitis has recently been associated with increased occurrence of complications. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38 MAPK) pathway occurs early in acute pancreatitis and its inhibition has been suggested to alleviate pancreatic inflammation. Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory steroids whose use in the management of acute pancreatitis remains controversial. Our aim was to examine the effect of crosstalk between pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) and stellate cells (PSCs) on p38 MAPK and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation and to assess the impact of hydrocortisone on these events.

A previously published structure visualized the monoiron cofactor in the enzyme's C-terminal cupin domain, which promotes the final rearrangement, but exhibited disorder and minimal metal occupancy in the site of the proposed diiron cofactor in the N-hydroxylating heme-oxygenase-like (HO-like) central domain. We leveraged our recent observation that the N-oxygenating µ-peroxodiiron(III/III) intermediate can form in the HO-like domain after the apo protein self-assembles its diiron(II/II) cofactor to solve structures of SznF with both of its iron cofactors bound. These structures of a biochemically validated member of the emerging heme-oxygenase-like diiron oxidase and oxygenase (HDO) superfamily with intact diiron cofactor reveal both the large-scale conformational change required to assemble the O2-reactive Fe2(II/II) complex and the structural basis for cofactor instability-a trait shared by the other validated HDOs. During cofactor (dis)assembly, a ligand-harboring core helix dynamically (un)folds. The diiron cofactor also coordinates an unanticipated Glu ligand contributed by an auxiliary helix implicated in substrate binding by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The additional carboxylate ligand is conserved in another N-oxygenating HDO but not in two HDOs that cleave carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds to install olefins.

However, its roles and action mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. Here, we analyzed MAP2K4 and its downstream kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) using immunohistochemical staining and their prognostic significances using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in our PDAC cohort. Then, we validated MAP2K4/JNK/p38 mRNA levels and prognostic significances using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Finally, we evaluated the effects of MAP2K4 on the proliferation and invasion of PDAC cells.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help in the distinction of these neoplasms, but a proportion is unclassifiable using recommended markers. Hence, additional markers useful for the typing of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms are needed. The reported frequencies of the different types of IPMNs in surgical series vary to some extent, and such data based on Danish patients are currently lacking. Besides, the role of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in these neoplasms has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of different types of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms in a Danish cohort. Furthermore, we aimed to examine the utility of CD117, CK17, CK20, MUC4, and villin as markers for their distinction, in addition to the recommended markers MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6 and CDX2, and to evaluate the frequency of MMR deficiency.

A subset of the tumours was examined with PCR for microsatellite instability (MSI). Most tumours were intestinal (40 %) and gastric (40 %) IPMNs, followed by pancreatobiliary (17 %) IPMNs and IOPN (3 %). All cases were MMR proficient.

Leveraging the diabetes-susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, we phenocopy the diabetes progression induced by programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade and identify a cascade of highly interdependent cellular interactions involving diabetogenic CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages. We demonstrate that exhausted CD8 T cells are the major cells that respond to PD-1 blockade producing high levels of IFN-γ. Most importantly, the activated T cells lead to the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages that become highly activated when responding to IFN-γ. These macrophages acquire cytocidal activity against β-cells via nitric oxide and induce autoimmune diabetes.

One of the most important factors in determining survival outcome that can be influenced by the surgeon is the R0 resection. However, the proximity of mesenteric vessels in cephalic pancreatic tumors, especially the mesenterico-portal venous axis, results in an increased risk of vein involvement and/or the presence of malignant cells in the venous bed margin. A concomitant venous resection can be performed to decrease the risk of a positive margin. Given the additional technical difficulty that this implies, many surgeons seek a path between the tumor and the vein, hoping for the absence of tumor infiltration into the perivascular tissue on pathologic analysis, particularly in cases with administration of neoadjuvant therapy. The definition of optimal surgical margin remains a subject of debate, but at least 1 mm is an independent predictor of survival after pancreatic cancer surgical resection. Although preoperative radiologic assessment is essential for accurate planning of a pancreatic resection, intraoperative decision-making with regard to resection of the mesenterico-portal vein in tumors with a venous contact remains unclear and variable. Although venous histologic involvement and perivascular infiltration are not accurately predictable preoperatively, clinicians must examine the existing criteria and normograms to guide their surgical management according to the integration of new imaging techniques, preoperative chemotherapy use, tumor biology and molecular histopathology, and surgical techniques.",eng,Ann Surg Oncol,9420840,1068-9265,aheadofprint,33479866,10.1245/s10434-020-09568-2,NA,NA,Ann Surg Oncol

PDAC CAFs are heterogeneous, but the nature of this heterogeneity is incompletely understood. The Hedgehog (HH) pathway functions in PDAC in a paracrine manner, with ligands secreted by cancer cells signaling to stromal cells in the microenvironment. Previous reports investigating the role of HH signaling in PDAC have been contradictory, with HH signaling alternately proposed to promote or restrict tumor growth. In light of the newly discovered CAF heterogeneity, we investigated how HH pathway inhibition reprograms the PDAC microenvironment.

Here we identify an inhibitor of insulin receptor (INSR) and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) signalling in mouse β-cells, which we name the insulin inhibitory receptor (inceptor; encoded by the gene Iir). Inceptor contains an extracellular cysteine-rich domain with similarities to INSR and IGF1R4, and a mannose 6-phosphate receptor domain that is also found in the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R)5. Knockout mice that lack inceptor (Iir-/-) exhibit signs of hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia, and die within a few hours of birth. Molecular and cellular analyses of embryonic and postnatal pancreases from Iir-/- mice showed an increase in the activation of INSR-IGF1R in Iir-/- pancreatic tissue, resulting in an increase in the proliferation and mass of β-cells. Similarly, inducible β-cell-specific Iir-/- knockout in adult mice and in ex vivo islets led to an increase in the activation of INSR-IGF1R and increased proliferation of β-cells, resulting in improved glucose tolerance in vivo. Mechanistically, inceptor interacts with INSR-IGF1R to facilitate clathrin-mediated endocytosis for receptor desensitization. Blocking this physical interaction using monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of inceptor resulted in the retention of inceptor and INSR at the plasma membrane to sustain the activation of INSR-IGF1R in β-cells.

No mouse models are currently available to recapitulate the human MODY5 disease. Here, we investigate the pancreatic phenotype of a unique MODY5 mouse model generated by heterozygous insertion of a human HNF1B splicing mutation at the intron-2 splice donor site in the mouse genome. This Hnf1bsp2/+ model generated with targeted mutation of Hnf1b mimicking the c.544+1G&gt;T (&lt;IVS2nt+1G&gt;T) mutation identified in humans, results in alternative transcripts and a 38% decrease of native Hnf1b transcript levels. As a clinical feature of MODY5 patients, the hypomorphic mouse model Hnf1bsp2/+ displays glucose intolerance. Whereas Hnf1bsp2/+ isolated islets showed no altered insulin secretion, we found a 65% decrease in pancreatic insulin content associated with a 30% decrease in total large islet volume and a 20% decrease in total β-cell volume. These defects were associated with a 30% decrease in expression of the pro-endocrine gene Neurog3 that we previously identified as a direct target of HNF1b, showing a developmental etiology.

We used a spontaneous PDA mouse model (KPC) crossed to IL17A knockout mice to show an extensive desmoplastic reaction, without impaired immune infiltration. Macrophages, especially CD80+ and T cells, were more abundant at the earlier time point. In T cells, a decrease in FoxP3+ cells and an increase in CD8+ T cells were observed in KPC/IL17A-/- mice. Fibroblasts isolated from IL17A+/+ and IL17A-/- KPC mice revealed very different messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein profiles. IL17A-/- fibroblasts displayed the ability to restrain tumor cell invasion by producing factors involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, increasing T cell recruitment, and producing higher levels of cytokines and chemokines favoring T helper 1 cell recruitment and activation and lower levels of those recruiting myeloid/granulocytic immune cells. Single-cell quantitative PCR on isolated fibroblasts confirmed a very divergent profile of IL17A-proficient and -deficient cells. All these features can be ascribed to increased levels of IL17F observed in the sera of IL17A-/- mice, and to the higher expression of its cognate receptor (IL17RC) specifically in IL17A-/- cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).

We had previously shown that PDAC can utilize its high levels of basal autophagy to support its metabolism and maintain tumor growth. Consistent with the importance of autophagy in PDAC, autophagy inhibition significantly enhances response of PDAC patients to chemotherapy in two randomized clinical trials. However, the specific metabolite(s) that autophagy provides to support PDAC growth is not yet known. In this study, we demonstrate that under nutrient-replete conditions, loss of autophagy in PDAC leads to a relatively restricted impairment of amino acid pools, with cysteine levels showing a significant drop. Additionally, we made the striking discovery that autophagy is critical for the proper membrane localization of the cystine transporter SLC7A11. Mechanistically, autophagy impairment results in the loss of SLC7A11 on the plasma membrane and increases its localization at the lysosome in an mTORC2-dependent manner.

It was 5 cm in diameter and detected in the upper gastric body with upper GI endoscopy conducted to investigate anemia. In the biopsy, although hyperplasia of gastric gland cells was noted, no tumor cells were found. Retrospectively, the diagnosis was misdiagnosed. An operation was arranged because bleeding from the tumor was suspected as a cause of anemia and because surgical resection was considered to be desirable for accurate diagnosis. Hence, laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery was performed. In the pathological examination, several types of epithelial cells that proliferated in the area between the mucosa and deep inside the submucosa were observed. These consisted of acinar-glandular/trabecular patterns and solid. A diagnosis of pancreatic-type acinar cell carcinoma of the stomach with NET G2 and G3 was made based on characteristic cellular findings and the results of immunostaining tests. Each of them consisted of more than 30% of the lesion; a diagnosis of pancreatic-type mixed acinar neuroendocrine carcinoma (pancreatic-type MiNEN) of the stomach or a type of gastric MiNEN was obtained.

In mouse models of pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis associated with tissue injury collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to markedly accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and, ultimately, adenocarcinoma2,3. Here, by integrating genomics, single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous mouse models, we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a unique chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is selected for throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges within 48 hours of pancreatic injury, and involves an 'acinar-to-neoplasia' chromatin switch that contributes to the early dysregulation of genes that define human pancreatic cancer. Among the factors that are most rapidly activated after tissue damage in the pre-malignant pancreatic epithelium is the alarmin cytokine interleukin 33, which recapitulates the effects of injury in cooperating with mutant Kras to unleash the epigenetic remodelling program of early neoplasia and neoplastic transformation. Collectively, our study demonstrates how gene-environment interactions can rapidly produce gene-regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment, and provides a molecular framework for understanding the interplay between genetic and environmental cues in the initiation of cancer.",eng,Nature,0410462,0028-0836,aheadofprint,33536616,10.1038/s41586-020-03147-x,NA,NA,Nature

It is considered that hyperglycemia-induced polyuria and dehydration cause decreased body-water volume, leading to decreased saliva secretion and, ultimately, xerostomia. In T2DM, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes tissue damage to vascular endothelial cells as well as epithelial tissue, including pancreas and cornea. Hence, a similar phenomenon may occur in other tissues and glands in a hyperglycemic environment.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Salivary gland tissue injury was examined, using T2DM model mouse (db/db). Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was conducted to evaluate tissue injury. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were measured as indicator of oxidative stress. Moreover, in vitro ROS production and cell injury was evaluated by mouse salivary gland-derived normal cells under high-glucose condition culture.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In vivo and in vitro analysis showed a higher percentage of TUNEL-positive cells and higher levels of MDA and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in salivary gland tissue of db/db mice. This suggests damage of saliva secretion-associated lipids and DNA by hyperglycemic-induced oxidative stress. To analyze the mechanism by which hyperglycemia promotes ROS production, mouse salivary gland-derived cells were isolated. The cell culture with high-glucose medium enhanced ROS production and promotes apoptotic and necrotic cell death.

While much of the risk associated with pancreatic leak is inherent to the operation, there have been no shortage of techniques employed by surgeons to try to mitigate that risk.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We focused on four topics of greatest conjecture with regard to reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy: (1) the type of anastomosis, (2) the enteral organ to which the pancreas is sewn, (3) whether to preserve the pylorus and (4) whether or not to use anastomotic silastic stents. We identified the most relevant randomized control trials on each topic, which were appropriately powered.

CP is the end stage of a progressive inflammatory syndrome that is diagnosed at late stages by morphologic features. To diagnose earlier stages of the disease, a new mechanistic definition was established based on identifying underlying pathogenic processes and biomarker evidence of disease activity and stage. Although multiple risk factors are known, the corresponding biomarkers needed to make a highly accurate diagnosis of earlier disease stages have not been established. The goal of this study is to systematically analyze the literature to identify the most likely candidates for development into biomarkers of CP.
