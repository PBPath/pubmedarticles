Label=""EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":To generate spatially-resolved tumor and immune cell data at single cell resolution, we developed two quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence assays to interrogate myeloid cells (CD15, CD14, ARG1, CD33, HLA-DR) and macrophages [CD68, CD163, CD86, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), MRC1 (CD206)] in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Spatial point pattern analyses were conducted to assess the degree of co-localization between tumor cells and immune cells. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations with patient outcomes.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In a multi-institutional cohort of 305 primary PDAC resection specimens, myeloid cells were abundant, enriched within stromal regions, highly heterogeneous across tumors, and differed by somatic genotype. High densities of CD15+ARG1+ immunosuppressive granulocytic cells and M2-polarized macrophages were associated with worse patient survival. Moreover, beyond cell density, closer proximity of M2-polarized macrophages to tumor cells was strongly associated with disease-free survival, revealing the clinical significance and biologic importance of immune cell localization within tumor areas.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":A diverse set of myeloid cells are present within the PDAC tumor microenvironment and are distributed heterogeneously across patient tumors. Not only the densities but also the spatial locations of myeloid immune cells are associated with patient outcomes, highlighting the potential role of spatially-resolved myeloid cell subtypes as quantitative biomarkers for PDAC prognosis and therapy.",eng,Clin Cancer Res,9502500,1078-0432,aheadofprint,33262135,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3141,NA,NA,Clin Cancer Res

This allows the study of digestive processes and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. However, detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure, perioperative management, a determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are scarce in the literature. Data of the long-term health status of minipigs upon EPI induction are still not available. Therefore, the present study describes in detail an experimental approach to the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency via pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs and the long term follow up of the animal's health state.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":14 Goettingen minipigs underwent pancreatic duct ligation via midline laparotomy for the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal fat content, fat absorption, chymotrypsin levels, body weight and blood vitamin and glucose levels were determined.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was successfully induced in 12 Goettingen minipigs. Two minipigs failed to develop exocrine insufficiency most likely due to undetected accessory pancreatic ducts. All animals tolerated the procedure very well and gained weight within 8 weeks after surgery without requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The follow up for approx. 180 weeks showed a stable body weight and health state of the animals with normal blood glucose levels (Table 1). From approx. 130 weeks post pancreatic duct ligation, all animals were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes and vitamins resulting in blood concentrations almost within the reference range.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs is an excellent method of inducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is important to identify and ligate accessory pancreatic ducts since persistence of accessory ducts will lead to maintenance of exocrine pancreatic function. The EPI model caused no persistent side effects in the animals and has the potential to be used in long-term EPI studies with up to 100 weeks post-OP without supplementation with enzymes and vitamins.",eng,BMC Gastroenterol,100968547,1471-230X,epublish,33256637,10.1186/s12876-020-01541-3,20,1,BMC Gastroenterol

Although, a primary respiratory pathogen, over the ensuing period, its extra-pulmonary effects have come to the forefront. The virus, having multi-organ tropism, has been shown to affect a host of other organs beyond the lung, including the pancreas. The data on pancreatic involvement by COVID-19, however, have been limited. Moreover, whether the effects on the pancreas are due to the direct effects of the virus or is just an epi-phenomenon is debatable. The prevalence of pancreatic injury and degree of injury are the other issues that need to be addressed. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and the management of the same in the COVID era needs to be tailored assessing the risk-benefit ratio for the same. Additionally, pancreatic surgery increases not only the morbidity of the patient, but also the risk of the operator and burden on the health care system. Hence, the decision for such major procedures needs to be rationalized for optimum benefit during this pandemic.

However, this operation is complex, and the peri-operative risk is high, making patients more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, establishing a risk model that predicts admission to ICU is meaningful in preventing patients from post-operation deterioration and potentially reducing socio-economic burden.

The features, such as age, duration of operation, monocyte count, and intra-operative partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), are risk factors in the ICU admission. The protective factors include RBC count, analgesic pump dexmedetomidine (DEX), and intra-operative maintenance of DEX. Basophil percentage, duration of the operation, and total infusion volume were risk variables for staying in ICU. The bilirubin, CA125, and pre-operative albumin were associated with the post-operative bleeding volume.

The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Due to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT, and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. 118 resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were selected from the cases between 2011-2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes. There were statistically significant differences for dystrophic calcification, eosinophilic tumor cell changes, elastotic stromal/vascular change, islet cell hyperplasia, and nerve hypertrophy between the two groups, with these features seen more frequently in NAT cases. Blue/grey stromal fibrosis was present in all cases regardless of NAT, except few complete regression cases and one treated case with intraneural invasion only. Blue/grey fibrosis is a useful histologic visual clue to suggest the possibility of adjacent tumor in the majority of PDAC cases regardless of NAT. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, neither grading scheme correlated with overall survival in our cohort.

Within this cohort of high-quality hospitals, thirty-day total episode, index hospitalization, physician, postacute care, and readmission spending was analyzed. Logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the probability of postoperative outcomes and post-discharge resource utilization.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":43,007 Medicare patients underwent either pancreas, esophageal, lung, rectal, or colon resection for cancer at a hospital within the highest-quality quintile. Among the highest quality hospitals, total episode spending ranged from $18,712 for colectomy to $38,054 for esophagectomy. Spending between the lowest- and highest spending hospitals varied from $1,207 (CI95% $1,195 to $1,220) or 6.6% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for colectomy to $5,706 (CI95% $5,506 to $5,906) or 16.1% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for esophagectomy. The largest component of variation was from postacute care spending followed by readmission. For all operations the risk-adjusted rate of postacute care facility utilization was lower among the lowest spending hospitals compared to the highest spending hospitals. For example, for pancreas the lowest-spending hospitals on average discharged patients to a postacute care facility at a rate of 18,6% (CI95% 16.2 to 20.9) compared to 31.0% (CI95% 28.2 to 33.9) in the highest-spending hospitals.

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody specific for tumor necrosis factor α that has already been approved for the treatment of several autoimmune conditions in adults and children. Whether golimumab could preserve beta-cell function in youth with newly diagnosed overt (stage 3) type 1 diabetes is unknown.                 Label=""METHODS"":In this phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, children and young adults (age range, 6 to 21 years) with newly diagnosed overt type 1 diabetes to receive subcutaneous golimumab or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was endogenous insulin production, as assessed according to the area under the concentration-time curve for C-peptide level in response to a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (4-hour C-peptide AUC) at week 52. Secondary and additional end points included insulin use, the glycated hemoglobin level, the number of hypoglycemic events, the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide over time, and response profile.                 Label=""RESULTS"":A total of 84 participants underwent randomization - 56 were assigned to the golimumab group and 28 to the placebo group. The mean (±SD) 4-hour C-peptide AUC at week 52 differed significantly between the golimumab group and the placebo group (0.64±0.42 pmol per milliliter vs. 0.43±0.39 pmol per milliliter, P&lt;0.001). A treat-to-target approach led to good glycemic control in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the groups in glycated hemoglobin level. Insulin use was lower with golimumab than with placebo. A partial-remission response (defined as an insulin dose-adjusted glycated hemoglobin level score [calculated as the glycated hemoglobin level plus 4 times the insulin dose] of ≤9) was observed in 43% of participants in the golimumab group and in 7% of those in the placebo group (difference, 36 percentage points; 95% CI, 22 to 55). The mean number of hypoglycemic events did not differ between the trial groups. Hypoglycemic events that were recorded as adverse events at the discretion of investigators were reported in 13 participants (23%) in the golimumab group and in 2 (7%) of those in the placebo group. Antibodies to golimumab were detected in 30 participants who received the drug; 29 had antibody titers lower than 1:1000, of whom 12 had positive results for neutralizing antibodies.

Current oncologic PDAC therapies confer marginal benefit and, thus, a significant unmet clinical need exists for new therapeutic strategies. To identify effective PDAC therapies, we leveraged a syngeneic orthotopic PDAC transplant mouse model to perform a large-scale, in vivo screen of 16 single-agent and 41 two-drug targeted therapy combinations in mice. Among 57 drug conditions screened, combined inhibition of heat shock protein (Hsp)-90 and MEK was found to produce robust suppression of tumor growth, leading to an 80% increase in the survival of PDAC-bearing mice with no significant toxicity. Mechanistically, we observed that single-agent MEK inhibition led to compensatory activation of resistance pathways, including components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, which was overcome with the addition of HSP90 inhibition. The combination of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) was also active in vitro in established human PDAC cell lines and in vivo in patient-derived organoid PDAC transplant models.

Gastroenterology &amp; hepatology,The overlap between irritable bowel syndrome and organic gastrointestinal diseases.,10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30212-0,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habit. This condition is one of the most frequent reasons to seek a gastroenterology consultation in primary and secondary care. The diagnosis of IBS is made by identifying characteristic symptoms, as defined by the Rome criteria, and excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases that might otherwise explain these symptoms. Organic conditions that can be mistaken for IBS include coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and, in those with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms, chronic gastrointestinal infections, microscopic colitis, and primary bile acid diarrhoea. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth being associated with IBS is shrouded with controversy and uncertainty, mainly because of invalid tests due to poor sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions. There is insufficient evidence to link IBS-type symptoms with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, since both are hampered by conflicting data. Finally, there is growing appreciation that IBS can present in patients with known but stable organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as quiescent IBD or coeliac disease. Recognising functional gut symptoms in these individuals is paramount so that potentially harmful escalations in immunosuppressive therapy can be avoided and attention can be focused on addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction.

Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD-NECs) have a relatively high Ki67 index, &gt;20% in all cases and commonly exceeding 50%. After anecdotally observing PD-NECs with an unexpectedly low and heterogeneous Ki67 index following chemotherapy in 5 cases, we identified 15 additional cases of treated high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (HG-NENs). The study cohort comprised 20 cases; 11 PD-NECs, 8 mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 WD-NET, G3 from various anatomic sites (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and breast). The Ki67 index was evaluated on pretreatment (when available) and posttreatment samples. Topographic heterogeneity in the Ki67 index was expressed using a semi-quantitative score of 0 (no heterogeneity) to 5 (&gt;80% difference between maximal Ki67 and minimal Ki67 indices). Relative to the pretreatment group (n=9, mean Ki67 of 86.3%, range 80% to 100%), the neoplasms in the posttreatment group (n=20, mean Ki67 of 47.7%, range 1% to 90%) showed a significantly lower Ki67 index (18/20 cases). Of the 18 cases with a relatively low Ki67 index, 15 showed heterogeneous labeling (mean heterogeneity score of 2.3, range 1 to 5) and in 3 cases it was a homogeneously low. This phenomenon was observed in all subtypes of HG-NENs. In 6 cases, the alterations in Ki67 index following treatment were sufficient to place these HG-NENs in the WHO G1 or G2 grade, erroneously suggesting a diagnosis of WD-NET, and in 9 cases there was sufficient heterogeneity in the Ki67 index to suggest that a limited biopsy may sample an area of low Ki67, even though hotspot regions with a Ki67 index of &gt;20% persisted. In 7 cases, the alterations in the Ki67 index were accompanied by morphologic features resembling a WD-NET. These observations suggest that there is a potential for misinterpretation of previously treated PD-NECs as WD-NETs, or for assigning a lower grade in G3 WD-NETs.

We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet.

Inhibiting CXCR4 in an experimental cancer medicine study by 1-wk continuous infusion of the small-molecule inhibitor AMD3100 (plerixafor) induces an integrated immune response that is detected by transcriptional analysis of paired biopsies of metastases from patients with microsatellite stable colorectal and pancreatic cancer. This integrated immune response occurs in three other examples of immune-mediated damage to noninfected tissues: Rejecting renal allografts, melanomas clinically responding to anti-PD1 antibody therapy, and microsatellite instable colorectal cancers.

The adaptor protein APPL1 promotes first-phase GSIS by up-regulating soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein expression. However, whether APPL2 (a close homology of APPL1 with the same domain organization) plays a role in β-cell functions is unknown. Here, we show that APPL2 enhances GSIS by promoting F-actin remodeling via the small GTPase Rac1 in pancreatic β-cells. β-cell specific abrogation of APPL2 impaired GSIS, leading to glucose intolerance in mice. APPL2 deficiency largely abolished glucose-induced first- and second-phase insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Real-time live-cell imaging and phalloidin staining revealed that APPL2 deficiency abolished glucose-induced F-actin depolymerization in pancreatic islets. Likewise, knockdown of APPL2 expression impaired glucose-stimulated F-actin depolymerization and subsequent insulin secretion in INS-1E cells, which were attributable to the impairment of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation. Treatment with the F-actin depolymerization chemical compounds or overexpression of gelsolin (a F-actin remodeling protein) rescued APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS. In addition, APPL2 interacted with Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RacGAP1) in a glucose-dependent manner via the bin/amphiphysin/rvs-pleckstrin homology (BAR-PH) domain of APPL2 in INS-1E cells and HEK293 cells. Concomitant knockdown of RacGAP1 expression reverted APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS, F-actin remodeling, and Rac1 activation in INS-1E cells. Our data indicate that APPL2 interacts with RacGAP1 and suppresses its negative action on Rac1 activity and F-actin depolymerization thereby enhancing GSIS in pancreatic β-cells.",eng,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,7505876,0027-8424,ppublish,33122440,10.1073/pnas.2016997117,117,45,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

Therefore, nearly, all solid tumors have a heterogeneous fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, which consists of myofibroblastic cells, extracellular matrix components, and infiltrates from various types of immune cell. In particular, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a prototype of a tumor with a pronounced inflammatory microenvironment, in which the majority of the tumor mass consists of nonneoplastic stromal and immune cells. Our own data and data from the literature indicate a protective role of tumor-infiltrating T cells for the host. On the other hand, we were able to show that a defined T cell subpopulation paradoxically promotes the progression of the tumor.

Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"":Since in the literature, a debate between cytology and histology supporters is still ongoing and the trend is changing in favor of FNB, we would like to present our experience about the diagnostic yield of FNA and FNB. The aim of our study is to highlight FNA versus FNB diagnostic role of biliopancreatic lesions, highlight advantages, and drawbacks of these procedures, and our view on these 2 procedures and whether they should still be considered complementary or opposing techniques.

Our experience confirmed that FNA is extremely efficient in the diagnosis of biliopancreatic lesions, especially in the hands of expert endoscopists and pathologists. Considering anatomic location, EUS-FNA is more accurate for mass-forming neoplasms in the pancreatic parenchyma rather than for lesions of the biliary system. Moreover, concomitant FNB usually confirmed the cytological diagnosis, allowing a deeper immunohistochemical characterization of the neoplasia.

Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and lack of curative treatment modalities, the 5-y survival rate of PDAC patients is one of the lowest of any cancer type. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted. Therefore, identification of effective drug combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify gene targets whose inhibition creates synergistic tumor growth inhibition with gemcitabine (Gem), a first- or second-line chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as an effective druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition indicate that loss of PRMT5 activity synergistically enhances Gem cytotoxicity due to the accumulation of excessive DNA damage. At the molecular level, we show that inhibition of PRMT5 results in RPA depletion and impaired homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) activity. The combination (Gem + PRMT5 inhibition) creates conditional lethality and synergistic reduction of PDAC tumors in vivo.

Previous studies demonstrate that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is critical for nab-paclitaxel uptake into tumors and correlates with response. Gemcitabine increases nab-paclitaxel uptake by increasing Cav-1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with gemcitabine would further enhance the sensitivity of PDAC to nab-paclitaxel by increasing Cav-1 expression and nab-paclitaxel uptake.                 Label=""EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We investigated the sensitivity of different gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment regimens in a panel of PDAC cell lines and orthotopic xenograft models. The sensitivity of different treatment regimens was compared to the standard concurrent treatment.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Pre-treatment with gemcitabine before nab-paclitaxel increased Cav-1 and albumin uptake and significantly decreased proliferation and clonogenicity compared to concurrent treatment, which correlated with increased levels of apoptosis. Cav-1 silencing reduced the uptake of albumin and therapeutic advantage observed when cells were pre-treated with gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel. Additionally, we observed that pre-treatment with gemcitabine resulted in partial synchronization of cells in the G2/M phase at the time of nab-paclitaxel treatment, providing another mechanism for the benefit of altered scheduling. In heterotopic and orthotopic xenograft models, the altered schedule of gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel significantly delayed tumor growth compared to concurrent delivery without added toxicity.

The majority of these lesions are benign but some progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is a dearth of mouse models of these conditions. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 regulates development, differentiation, and inflammation. Germline Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes mice to the oncogenic effects of mutant Kras in the pancreas. Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras (KPN+/- ), leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high-grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6, but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2, and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC. These results highlight that the effects of loss of one Nr5a2 allele are time- and cell context-dependent. KPN+/- mice represent a new model to study the formation of cystic pancreatic lesions and their relationship with PanINs and classical PDAC.

Two of these were identified in 1750 consecutive cholecystectomies reviewed specifically for this purpose, placing its incidence at 0.1%. Median age was 68 years. Unlike other gallbladder lesions, these were slightly more common in men (female/male=0.8), and 55% had documented cholelithiasis. All were characterized by a compact multilocular, demarcated, cystic lesion with papillary proliferations and mucinous epithelial lining. The lesions' architecture, distribution, location, and typical size were suggestive of evolution from an underlying adenomyomatous nodule. All had gastric/endocervical-like mucinous epithelium, but 5 also had a focal intestinal-like epithelium. Cytologic atypia was graded as 1 to 3 and defined as 1A: mucinous, without cytoarchitectural atypia (n=3), 1B: mild (n=7), 2: moderate (n=2), and 3: severe atypia (n=7, 3 of which also had invasive carcinoma, 16%). Background gallbladder mucosal involvement was absent in all but 2 cases, both of which had multifocal papillary mucosal nodules. In conclusion, these cases highlight a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, mural ICNs arising in adenomyomatous nodules, which, by essentially sparing the &quot;main&quot; mucosa, not displaying &quot;field-effect/defect&quot; phenomenon, and only rarely (16%) showing carcinomatous transformation, are analogous to pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.",eng,Am J Surg Pathol,7707904,0147-5185,ppublish,33060404,10.1097/PAS.0000000000001603,44,12,Am J Surg Pathol

There is an unmet need to develop strategies to detect PaCa at an early, operable stage and prevent its progression. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic PaCa precursors that comprise nearly 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally via cross-sectional imaging. Since IPMNs can progress from low- and moderate-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasion, the study of these lesions offers a prime opportunity to develop early detection and prevention strategies. Organoids are an ideal preclinical platform to study IPMNs, and the objective of the current investigation was to establish a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from IPMNs. IPMN tumors and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were successfully harvested from 15 patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic surgical resection at Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute (Tampa, FL) between May of 2017 and March of 2019. Organoid cultures were also generated from cryopreserved tissues. Organoid count and size were determined over time by both Image-Pro Premier 3D Version 9.1 digital platform and Matlab application of a Circular Hough Transform algorithm, and histologic and genomic characterization of a subset of the organoids was performed using immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing, respectively. The success rates for organoid generation from IPMN tumor and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were 81% and 87%, respectively. IPMN organoids derived from different epithelial subtypes showed different morphologies in vitro, and organoids recapitulated histologic and genomic characteristics of the parental IPMN tumor.

These limitations often result in delayed or failed diagnosis, which negatively impact patient management and outcomes. This study aimed to create an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to differentiate AIP from PDAC, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal pancreas (NP), with sufficient performance to analyse EUS video in real time.                 Label=""DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A database of still image and video data obtained from EUS examinations of cases of AIP, PDAC, CP and NP was used to develop a CNN. Occlusion heatmap analysis was used to identify sonographic features the CNN valued when differentiating AIP from PDAC.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":From 583 patients (146 AIP, 292 PDAC, 72 CP and 73 NP), a total of 1 174 461 unique EUS images were extracted. For video data, the CNN processed 955 EUS frames per second and was: 99% sensitive, 98% specific for distinguishing AIP from NP; 94% sensitive, 71% specific for distinguishing AIP from CP; 90% sensitive, 93% specific for distinguishing AIP from PDAC; and 90% sensitive, 85% specific for distinguishing AIP from all studied conditions (ie, PDAC, CP and NP).

Characteristics and OS of patients with mutations in eight genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D) involved in HRR were compared with patients testing negative for mutations in all 37 genes.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The 175 HRR mutation carriers and 2,730 noncarriers in the study had a median duration of follow-up of 9.9 years. HRR mutation carriers were younger (median age at diagnosis: 63 vs. 66 years, P &lt; 0.001) and more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis (46% vs. 36%, P = 0.004). In a multivariable model adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, and tumor staging, patients with germline HRR mutations had a significantly longer OS compared with noncarriers [HR, 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70-0.97; P = 0.02]. Further gene-level analysis demonstrated that germline ATM mutation carriers had longer OS compared with patients without germline mutations in any of the 37 genes (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.94; P = 0.01).

The current study aimed to investigate the significance of the anatomic location of the pancreas as a predictor for POPF in both laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and open gastrectomy (OG).                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":In total, 233 patients with gastric cancer were assessed retrospectively. We measured the maximum vertical (P-L height; PLH) and horizontal length (P-L depth; PLD) between the upper border of pancreas and the root of left gastric artery on a preoperative CT in the sagittal direction. The maximum length of the vertical line between the surface of the pancreas and the aorta (P-A length), previously reported as prognostic factor of POPF, was also measured. We investigated the correlations between these parameters and the incidence of POPF in LG and OG groups.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Among the patients in this study, 118 underwent OG and 115 underwent LG. In LG, the median PLH and P-A length in patients with POPF were significantly longer compared with those without POPF (p = 0.026, 0.034, respectively), but not in OG. There was no significant difference in the median PLD between the patients with or without POPF in both LG and OG. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that PLH (odds ratio [OR] 4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-11.3, P = 0.004) and P-A length (OR 4.06, 95%CI 1.05-15.7, P = 0.042] were independent factors for predicting POPF in LG. However, intraoperative blood loss (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.05-6.18, P = 0.038) was extracted as an independent factor in OG. The median amylase level in the drained fluid (D-Amy) were significantly higher in patients with high PLH(≥12.4 mm) or high P-A length (≥45 mm) compared with those with low PLH or low P-A length in LG. However, there were no differences in the D-Amy levels by PLH or P-A length in OG patients.

Breast cancer can be categorized as estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive luminal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) types based on the expression of ER, PR, and HER2. Although GATA3 is the most widely used tumor marker at present to determine the breast origin, which has been shown to be an excellent marker for ER-positive and low-grade breast cancer, but it does not work well for TNBC with sensitivity as low as &lt;20% in metaplastic breast carcinoma. In the current study, through TCGA data mining we identified trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) as a specific gene for breast carcinoma across 31 solid tumor types. Moreover, high mRNA level of TRPS1 was found in all four subtypes of breast carcinoma including ER/PR-positive luminal A and B types, HER2-positive type, and basal-type/TNBC. We then analyzed TRPS1 expression in 479 cases of various types of breast cancer using immunochemistry staining, and found that TRPS1 and GATA3 had comparable positive expression in ER-positive (98% vs. 95%) and HER2-positive (87% vs. 88%) breast carcinomas. However, TRPS1 which was highly expressed in TNBC, was significantly higher than GATA3 expression in metaplastic (86% vs. 21%) and nonmetaplastic (86% vs. 51%) TNBC. In addition, TRPS1 expression was evaluated in 1234 cases of solid tumor from different organs. In contrast to the high expression of GATA3 in urothelial carcinoma, TRPS1 showed no or little expression in urothelial carcinomas or in other tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colon and gastric adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. These findings suggest that TRPS1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for breast carcinoma and can be used as a great diagnostic tool, especially for TNBC.",eng,Mod Pathol,8806605,0893-3952,aheadofprint,33011748,10.1038/s41379-020-00692-8,NA,NA,Mod Pathol

Despite the high prevalence of Kras mutations in pancreatic cancer patients, murine models expressing the oncogenic mutant Kras (Krasmut) in mature pancreatic cells develop PDAC at a low frequency. Independent of cell of origin, a second genetic hit (loss of tumor suppressor TP53 or PTEN) is important for development of PDAC in mice. We hypothesized ectopic expression and elevated levels of oncogenic mutant Kras would promote PanIN arising in pancreatic ducts. To test our hypothesis, the significance of elevating levels of K-Ras and Ras activity has been explored by expression of a CAG driven LGSL-KrasG12V allele (cKras) in pancreatic ducts, which promotes ectopic Kras expression. We predicted expression of cKras in pancreatic ducts would generate neoplasia and PDAC. To test our hypothesis, we employed tamoxifen dependent CreERT2 mediated recombination. Hnf1b:CreERT2;KrasG12V (cKrasHnf1b/+) mice received 1 (Low), 5 (Mod) or 10 (High) mg per 20 g body weight to recombine cKras in low (cKrasLow), moderate (cKrasMod), and high (cKrasHigh) percentages of pancreatic ducts. Our histologic analysis revealed poorly differentiated aggressive tumors in cKrasHigh mice. cKrasMod mice had grades of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN), recapitulating early and advanced PanIN observed in human PDAC. Proteomics analysis revealed significant differences in PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways between wild type, cKrasLow, cKrasMod, and cKrasHigh mice. In conclusion, in this study, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in pancreatic ducts generates early and late PanIN as well as PDAC. This Ras rheostat model provides evidence that AKT signaling is an important early driver of invasive ductal derived PDAC.",eng,Lab Invest,0376617,0023-6837,aheadofprint,33009500,10.1038/s41374-020-00490-5,NA,NA,Lab Invest
