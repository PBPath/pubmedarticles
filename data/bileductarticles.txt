The incidence of biliary malignant tumors with neuroendocrine tumors accounts for less than 1% of all neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, the incidence of hilar bile duct with MANEC is very rare.                 Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 65-year-old female patient came to our hospital for repeated abdominal pain for more than 4 months and skin sclera yellow staining for 1 week. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging and magnetic resonance results suggested a hilar tumor for Bismuth-Corlette Type II. The patient underwent radical surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with hilar bile duct MANEC, staged 1 (pT1N0M0) based on the eighth edition of the AJCC. Histopathology showed that the tumor was a biliary tumor with both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. No evidence of recurrence and metastasis after 20 months of follow-up.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":We first reported a MANEC that originated in the hilar bile duct. As far as we known, there were few reports of biliary MANEC, and the overall prognosis was poor. We also found that the higher the Ki-67 index, the worse the prognosis of this type of patient. Radical surgery is the most effective treatment.",eng,BMC Gastroenterol,100968547,1471-230X,epublish,33238879,10.1186/s12876-020-01550-2,20,1,BMC Gastroenterol

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) shows variable sensitivity, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) and metastatic carcinoma are generally negative. We studied the clinical utility and limitations of albumin mRNA detection in a cohort of HCCs, ICCs, ECCs, bile duct adenomas, bile duct hamartomas, and metastatic carcinomas to the liver; and investigated the variability in sensitivity observed for this biomarker in ICCs. We identified 122 cases of hepatobiliary lesions and metastatic carcinomas. Albumin mRNA detection was performed using RNAscope run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. ICCs were categorized according to the classification proposed by Hayashi and colleagues into the small duct, large duct, and indeterminate subtypes. Albumin mRNA was detected in all 17 HCCs and focally in 6/8 (75%) of bile duct adenomas. All 28 nonhepatic carcinomas, 13 bile duct hamartomas, and 9 ECCs were negative. Albumin mRNA was found in 38/47 (80.9%) of ICC with 35/37 (94.6%) in the small duct subtype, 2/3 (66.7%) in the indeterminate subtype, and 1/7 (14.3%) of the large duct subtype (P&lt;0.003). Albumin mRNA detection is a sensitive and specific biomarker for HCCs. It is highly sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of ICC with small gland morphology, but not ICCs with large duct morphology and in metastatic carcinoma. The variability in the sensitivity of albumin mRNA expression in ICCs may depend on the subtypes of ICC.",eng,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,100888796,1533-4058,aheadofprint,33208670,10.1097/PAI.0000000000000885,NA,NA,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol

Interpretation of intraductal biopsies is frequently challenging. The diagnosis often suffers from interobserver disagreement, which has not been studied in the literature.

Eighty-five biopsies were retrieved, falling into five diagnostic categories: negative for dysplasia (NED), indefinite for dysplasia (IND), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and carcinoma (CA). Eight gastrointestinal pathologists blindly reviewed all the slides. Agreement among pathologists was analyzed using Fleiss κ and weighted concordance coefficient S∗. A face-to-face consensus/training session was held to discuss the classification criteria, followed by a second round review. The overall interobserver agreement was fair in the first round review (κ = 0.39; S∗ = 0.56) and improved to moderate in the second round review (κ = 0.48; S∗ = 0.69).

The effect of oral administration of octreotide (OCT), a drug that reduces PH by the constriction of mesenteric arteries, is limited by a remarkable intestinal first-pass elimination.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":The bile duct ligation (BDL) was used in rats to induce liver cirrhosis with PH to examine the kinetics and molecular factors such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) influencing the intestinal OCT absorption via in situ and in vitro experiments on jejunal segments, transportation experiments on Caco-2 cells and experiments using intestinal microsomes and recombinant human CYP3A4. Moreover, RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Both in situ and in vitro experiments in jejunal segments showed that intestinal OCT absorption in both control and PH rats was largely controlled by P-gp and, to a lesser extent, by MRP2. OCT transport mediated by P-gp and MRP2 was demonstrated on Caco-2 cells. The results of RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry suggested that impaired OCT absorption in PH was in part due to the jejunal upregulation of these two transporters. The use of intestinal microsomes and recombinant human CYP3A4 revealed that CYP3A4 metabolized OCT, and its upregulation in PH likely contributed to impaired drug absorption.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Wnt signaling activation, marked by Axin2, was limited to PBGs located in the periampullary region. Lineage tracing revealed that Axin2-expressing periampullary PBG cells are capable of self-renewal and supplying new biliary epithelial cells (BECs) to the luminal surface. Additionally, the expression pattern of Axin2 and the mature ductal cell marker CK19 was mutually exclusive in periampullary region, and fate tracing of CK19+ luminal surface BECs revealed gradual replacement by CK19- cells, further supporting the continuous replenishment of new BECs from PBGs to the luminal surface. We also found that Wnt signal enhancer R-spondin3 secreted from Myh11-expressing stromal cells, corresponding to human sphincter of Oddi, maintained the periampullary Wnt signal-activating niche. Notably, introduction of PTEN deletion into Axin2+ PBG cells, but not CK19+ luminal surface BECs, induced ampullary carcinoma whose development was suppressed by Wnt inhibitor.

As a clinically defined entity, its pathologic correlates are poorly characterized. Eighty-four resected CCs from the West were reanalyzed. After applying established Japanese criteria, 9/66 with available imaging were disqualified and 10/39 with preoperative cyst typing had to be recategorized. None had been diagnosed with, or evaluated for, pancreatobiliary maljunction, but on retrospective analysis of radiologic images, 12/66 were found to have pancreatobiliary maljunction. The clinical findings were: F/M=5.7; mean age, 48; most (77%) presented with abdominal pain; mean size, 2.9 cm; choledocholithiasis 11%. Gross/histologic examination revealed 3 distinct pathology-based categories: (I) Cystic dilatation of native ducts (81%). (II) Double bile duct (13%), almost all of which were found in women (10/11); all were diagnosed by pathologic examination, and not preoperative diagnosis. (III) Gastrointestinal (GI) duplication type (6%). Microscopic findings of the entire cohort included mucosal-predominant lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (50%), follicular cholangitis (7%), mucosal hyperplasia (43%; 13% with papillae), intestinal metaplasia (10%), BilIN-like hyperplasia (17%), erosion/ulceration (13%), and severe dysplasia-mimicking atypia including &quot;detachment atypia&quot; and micropapillary degeneration (11%).

In conclusion, diagnostic imaging guidelines used in Asia are not routinely used (but should be adopted) in the West. Pathologically, cases designated as CC are classifiable in 3 groups: category 1 (dilated native duct type), more prone to carcinomatous change; category 2, double-duct phenomenon (all but 1 being female in this study); and category 3, GI-type duplication.
