33238879,2020,11,1471-230X,BMC gastroenterology,Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the hepatic bile duct: a case report and review of the literature.,10.1186/s12876-020-01550-2,"Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":The World Health Organization's updated classification of digestive system neuroendocrine tumors in 2010 first proposed the classification of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC). The incidence of biliary malignant tumors with neuroendocrine tumors accounts for less than 1% of all neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, the incidence of hilar bile duct with MANEC is very rare.                 Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 65-year-old female patient came to our hospital for repeated abdominal pain for more than 4 months and skin sclera yellow staining for 1 week. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging and magnetic resonance results suggested a hilar tumor for Bismuth-Corlette Type II. The patient underwent radical surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with hilar bile duct MANEC, staged 1 (pT1N0M0) based on the eighth edition of the AJCC. Histopathology showed that the tumor was a biliary tumor with both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. No evidence of recurrence and metastasis after 20 months of follow-up.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":We first reported a MANEC that originated in the hilar bile duct. As far as we known, there were few reports of biliary MANEC, and the overall prognosis was poor. We also found that the higher the Ki-67 index, the worse the prognosis of this type of patient. Radical surgery is the most effective treatment.",eng,BMC Gastroenterol,100968547,1471-230X,epublish,33238879,10.1186/s12876-020-01550-2,20,1,BMC Gastroenterol

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) shows variable sensitivity, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) and metastatic carcinoma are generally negative. We studied the clinical utility and limitations of albumin mRNA detection in a cohort of HCCs, ICCs, ECCs, bile duct adenomas, bile duct hamartomas, and metastatic carcinomas to the liver; and investigated the variability in sensitivity observed for this biomarker in ICCs. We identified 122 cases of hepatobiliary lesions and metastatic carcinomas. Albumin mRNA detection was performed using RNAscope run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. ICCs were categorized according to the classification proposed by Hayashi and colleagues into the small duct, large duct, and indeterminate subtypes. Albumin mRNA was detected in all 17 HCCs and focally in 6/8 (75%) of bile duct adenomas. All 28 nonhepatic carcinomas, 13 bile duct hamartomas, and 9 ECCs were negative. Albumin mRNA was found in 38/47 (80.9%) of ICC with 35/37 (94.6%) in the small duct subtype, 2/3 (66.7%) in the indeterminate subtype, and 1/7 (14.3%) of the large duct subtype (P&lt;0.003). Albumin mRNA detection is a sensitive and specific biomarker for HCCs. It is highly sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of ICC with small gland morphology, but not ICCs with large duct morphology and in metastatic carcinoma. The variability in the sensitivity of albumin mRNA expression in ICCs may depend on the subtypes of ICC.",eng,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,100888796,1533-4058,aheadofprint,33208670,10.1097/PAI.0000000000000885,NA,NA,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol

Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":PBM (anomalous union of common bile duct and pancreatic duct) is mostly regarded as an Asian-only disorder, with 200X risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC), attributed to reflux of pancreatic enzymes.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Radiologic images of 840 patients in the U.S. who underwent pancreatobiliary resections were reviewed for PBM and contrasted with 171 GBC cases from Japan.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Eight % of the US GBCs (24/300) had PBM (similar to Japan; 15/171, 8.8%), in addition to 1/42 bile duct carcinomas and 5/33 choledochal cysts. None of the 30 PBM cases from the US had been diagnosed as PBM in the original work-up. PBM was not found in other pancreatobiliary disorders. Clinicopathologic features of the 39 PBM-associated GBCs (US:24, Japan:15) were similar; however, comparison with non-PBM GBCs revealed that they occurred predominantly in females (F/M = 3); at younger (&lt;50-year-old) age (21% vs. 6.5% in non-PBM GBCs; p = 0.01); were uncommonly associated with gallstones (14% vs. 58%; p &lt; 0.001); had higher rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (69% vs. 44%; p = 0.04); arose more often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.02); and had a higher proportion of non-conventional carcinomas (21% vs. 7%; p = 0.03).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":PBM accounts for 8% of GBCs also in the West but is typically undiagnosed. PBM-GBCs tend to manifest in younger age and often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to unusual carcinoma types. If PBM is encountered, cholecystectomy and surveillance of bile ducts is warranted. PBM-associated GBCs offer an invaluable model for variant anatomy-induced chemical (reflux-related) carcinogenesis.",eng,Ann Surg,0372354,0003-4932,aheadofprint,33201123,10.1097/SLA.0000000000004482,NA,NA,Ann Surg

Interpretation of intraductal biopsies is frequently challenging. The diagnosis often suffers from interobserver disagreement, which has not been studied in the literature. We sought to assess interobserver concordance in the interpretation of intraductal biopsies. Eighty-five biopsies were retrieved, falling into five diagnostic categories: negative for dysplasia (NED), indefinite for dysplasia (IND), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and carcinoma (CA). Eight gastrointestinal pathologists blindly reviewed all the slides. Agreement among pathologists was analyzed using Fleiss κ and weighted concordance coefficient S∗. A face-to-face consensus/training session was held to discuss the classification criteria, followed by a second round review. The overall interobserver agreement was fair in the first round review (κ = 0.39; S∗ = 0.56) and improved to moderate in the second round review (κ = 0.48; S∗ = 0.69). The agreement before and after consensus meeting was substantial to nearly perfect for CA (κ = 0.65, S∗ = 0.83; and κ = 0.80, S∗ = 0.91), fair for HGD (κ = 0.28, S∗ = 0.69; and κ = 0.40, S∗ = 0.63), and moderate for NED (κ = 0.47, S∗ = 0.50; and κ = 0.47, S∗ = 0.53). Agreement improved from fair to moderate for LGD (κ = 0.36, S∗ = 0.61; and κ = 0.49, S∗ = 0.71) and slight to fair for IND (κ = 0.16, S∗ = 0.51; and κ = 0.33, S∗ = 0.50). Compared with Hollande's fixed specimens, the agreement was higher in almost all diagnostic categories in formalin-fixed biopsies. Overall, interobserver concordance was improved after a consensus/training session. Interobserver reproducibility was high at the end of the diagnostic spectrum (CA) but fair to moderate for other diagnostic categories.",eng,Hum Pathol,9421547,0046-8177,aheadofprint,33129823,10.1016/j.humpath.2020.10.003,107,NA,Hum Pathol

[et al.],The use of immunohistochemistry for IgG4 in the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,10.1016/j.pan.2020.10.028,"Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) remains challenging, especially when serum IgG4 is normal or imaging features are indeterminate. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissues as a diagnostic aid for AIP.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted until February 2020. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. A random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio and other measures of accuracy.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The meta-analysis included 20 studies comprising 346 patients with AIP and 590 patients with other pancreatobiliary diseases, including 371 pancreatobiliary malignancies. The summary estimates for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls were as follows: diagnostic odds ratio 38.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 18.70-80.75); sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI, 0.59-0.69); specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.95). The area under the curve was 0.939 for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy according to control groups (pancreatobiliary cancer versus other chronic pancreatitis) and sampling site (pancreas versus bile duct/ampulla).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Current data demonstrate that IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissue has a high specificity but moderate sensitivity for diagnosing AIP. IgG4 immunostaining may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of AIP when AIP is clinically suspected, but a combination of imaging and serology does not provide a conclusive diagnosis.",eng,Pancreatology,100966936,1424-3903,ppublish,33060017,10.1016/j.pan.2020.10.028,20,8,Pancreatology
