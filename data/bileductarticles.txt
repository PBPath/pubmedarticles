The incidence of biliary malignant tumors with neuroendocrine tumors accounts for less than 1% of all neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, the incidence of hilar bile duct with MANEC is very rare.                 Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 65-year-old female patient came to our hospital for repeated abdominal pain for more than 4 months and skin sclera yellow staining for 1 week. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging and magnetic resonance results suggested a hilar tumor for Bismuth-Corlette Type II. The patient underwent radical surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with hilar bile duct MANEC, staged 1 (pT1N0M0) based on the eighth edition of the AJCC. Histopathology showed that the tumor was a biliary tumor with both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. No evidence of recurrence and metastasis after 20 months of follow-up.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":We first reported a MANEC that originated in the hilar bile duct. As far as we known, there were few reports of biliary MANEC, and the overall prognosis was poor. We also found that the higher the Ki-67 index, the worse the prognosis of this type of patient. Radical surgery is the most effective treatment.",eng,BMC Gastroenterol,100968547,1471-230X,epublish,33238879,10.1186/s12876-020-01550-2,20,1,BMC Gastroenterol

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) shows variable sensitivity, whereas extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) and metastatic carcinoma are generally negative. We studied the clinical utility and limitations of albumin mRNA detection in a cohort of HCCs, ICCs, ECCs, bile duct adenomas, bile duct hamartomas, and metastatic carcinomas to the liver; and investigated the variability in sensitivity observed for this biomarker in ICCs. We identified 122 cases of hepatobiliary lesions and metastatic carcinomas. Albumin mRNA detection was performed using RNAscope run on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. ICCs were categorized according to the classification proposed by Hayashi and colleagues into the small duct, large duct, and indeterminate subtypes. Albumin mRNA was detected in all 17 HCCs and focally in 6/8 (75%) of bile duct adenomas. All 28 nonhepatic carcinomas, 13 bile duct hamartomas, and 9 ECCs were negative. Albumin mRNA was found in 38/47 (80.9%) of ICC with 35/37 (94.6%) in the small duct subtype, 2/3 (66.7%) in the indeterminate subtype, and 1/7 (14.3%) of the large duct subtype (P&lt;0.003). Albumin mRNA detection is a sensitive and specific biomarker for HCCs. It is highly sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of ICC with small gland morphology, but not ICCs with large duct morphology and in metastatic carcinoma. The variability in the sensitivity of albumin mRNA expression in ICCs may depend on the subtypes of ICC.",eng,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,100888796,1533-4058,aheadofprint,33208670,10.1097/PAI.0000000000000885,NA,NA,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Radiologic images of 840 patients in the U.S. who underwent pancreatobiliary resections were reviewed for PBM and contrasted with 171 GBC cases from Japan.

None of the 30 PBM cases from the US had been diagnosed as PBM in the original work-up. PBM was not found in other pancreatobiliary disorders. Clinicopathologic features of the 39 PBM-associated GBCs (US:24, Japan:15) were similar; however, comparison with non-PBM GBCs revealed that they occurred predominantly in females (F/M = 3); at younger (&lt;50-year-old) age (21% vs. 6.5% in non-PBM GBCs; p = 0.01); were uncommonly associated with gallstones (14% vs. 58%; p &lt; 0.001); had higher rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (69% vs. 44%; p = 0.04); arose more often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.02); and had a higher proportion of non-conventional carcinomas (21% vs. 7%; p = 0.03).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":PBM accounts for 8% of GBCs also in the West but is typically undiagnosed. PBM-GBCs tend to manifest in younger age and often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to unusual carcinoma types.

Interpretation of intraductal biopsies is frequently challenging. The diagnosis often suffers from interobserver disagreement, which has not been studied in the literature. We sought to assess interobserver concordance in the interpretation of intraductal biopsies. Eighty-five biopsies were retrieved, falling into five diagnostic categories: negative for dysplasia (NED), indefinite for dysplasia (IND), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and carcinoma (CA). Eight gastrointestinal pathologists blindly reviewed all the slides. Agreement among pathologists was analyzed using Fleiss κ and weighted concordance coefficient S∗. A face-to-face consensus/training session was held to discuss the classification criteria, followed by a second round review. The overall interobserver agreement was fair in the first round review (κ = 0.39; S∗ = 0.56) and improved to moderate in the second round review (κ = 0.48; S∗ = 0.69).
