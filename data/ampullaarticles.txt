Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 6735 individuals were diagnosed with GEP-NEN in Japan in 2016. Annual onset incidence was 0.70/100,000 for pancreatic NEN and 2.84/100,000 for gastrointestinal NEN. NEN in the ileum accounted for only 1% of total GEP-NENs in Japan. Most NENs in the esophagus or lungs were neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), while the majority of those in the duodenum, ileum, appendix and rectum were grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Median age at initial diagnosis was in between 60 to 65. Tumors in the duodenum, appendix and rectum were mostly limited to local, while those in the esophagus, stomach and colon tended to show distant metastasis.

Coeliac disease is the most well-known example, causing intraepithelial lymphocytosis, inflammation and villous atrophy in the duodenum. Remarkably similar inflammatory changes can be induced by other processes, including medications, e.g. angiotensin II receptor blockers and immune checkpoint inhibitors, immune dysregulation disorders, e.g. common variable immunodeficiency and autoimmune enteropathy, infections, collagenous sprue, and tropical sprue. However, there are often subtle histological differences from coeliac disease in the type of inflammatory infiltrate, the presence of crypt apoptosis, and the extent and type of inflammation beyond the duodenum. The clinical setting and serological investigation usually allow diagnostic separation, but some cases remain challenging. Histopathology is also important in assessing the response to treatment, such as the change in villous architecture caused by a gluten-free diet, or the response to cessation of a potentially causative medication.

Histologically, the duodenal mucosa may show a variable pattern from unremarkable to a slight increase in the number of T lymphocytes in the superficial epithelium of villi. The endorsement of this disease is based on a positive response to a gluten-free diet for a limited period, followed by the reappearance of symptoms after gluten challenge.
