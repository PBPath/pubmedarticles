Although HuSaVs were discovered four decades ago, no HuSaV has been grown in vitro, which has significantly impeded the understanding of viral biology and the development of antiviral strategies. In this study, we identified two susceptible human cell lines, that originated from testis and duodenum, that support HuSaV replication and found that replication requires bile acids. HuSaVs replicated more efficiently in the duodenum cell line, and viral RNA levels increased up to âˆ¼6 log10-fold. We also detected double-stranded RNA, viral nonstructural and structural proteins in the cell cultures, and intact HuSaV particles. We confirmed the infectivity of progeny viruses released into the cell culture supernatants by passaging. These results indicate the successful growth of HuSaVs in vitro. Additionally, we determined the minimum infectious dose and tested the sensitivities of HuSaV GI.1 and GII.3 to heat and ultraviolet treatments. This system is inexpensive, scalable, and reproducible in different laboratories, and can be used to investigate mechanisms of HuSaV replication and to evaluate antivirals and/or disinfection methods for HuSaVs.",eng,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,7505876,0027-8424,aheadofprint,33257564,10.1073/pnas.2007310117,NA,NA,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

Here, the Japan Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (JNETS) planned to investigate the recent incidence and distribution of these tumors using data from the national cancer registry started in 2016. This study examined the incidence and distribution of primary sites as well as rate of advanced disease from this population-based registry.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A retrospective, population-based study using data from the national cancer registry in Japan (NCR) was conducted to evaluate patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic NEN (GEP-NEN) in 2016. Associated population data were used to determine annual age-adjusted incidences.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 6735 individuals were diagnosed with GEP-NEN in Japan in 2016. Annual onset incidence was 0.70/100,000 for pancreatic NEN and 2.84/100,000 for gastrointestinal NEN. NEN in the ileum accounted for only 1% of total GEP-NENs in Japan. Most NENs in the esophagus or lungs were neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), while the majority of those in the duodenum, ileum, appendix and rectum were grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Median age at initial diagnosis was in between 60 to 65. Tumors in the duodenum, appendix and rectum were mostly limited to local, while those in the esophagus, stomach and colon tended to show distant metastasis. In Japan, initial treatment for GEP-NENs was resection even if the tumor was NEC.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This is the first report of a national registry-based incidence and distribution of GEP-NEN in Japan. These data will serve as an important first step to determining the exact etiology and trends for this pathology in Japan.",eng,BMC Cancer,100967800,1471-2407,epublish,33189127,10.1186/s12885-020-07581-y,20,1,BMC Cancer

These lesions can be recognized in association with prevalent gastrointestinal underlying conditions, such as Barrett oesophagus, chronic atrophic gastritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The diagnosis of these special types can be challenging, and their biologic behaviours are not fully characterized. The aim of this review is to provide a global view of non-conventional dysplastic lesions observed in the various segments of the tubular gastrointestinal tract and describe their salient features. Furthermore, as the clinical implications of these various subtypes have not been broadly tested in practice and are not represented in most management guidelines, we offer guidance on the best management practices for these lesions.",eng,Histopathology,7704136,0309-0167,aheadofprint,33124049,10.1111/his.14294,NA,NA,Histopathology

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is usually part of a disseminated disease in AIDS patients with a low CD4 count, however with standard antiretroviral therapy (ART), a localized presentation is more likely. It can affect any part of the GIT, mostly the duodenum and typically as patches. Incomplete or refractory ART for HIV-strains, therapy-related side effects, noncompliant or incomplete treatment to previous MAIC infections, superimposed complications and comorbid opportunistic infections may result in atypical clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic manifestations. We performed a retrospective review study retrieving cases of MAIC in duodenal endoscopic biopsy. We found five cases of MAIC in HIV/AIDS patients. They were males with an average age of 40-years. They showed different histopathologic features, variable patterns of MAIC-histiocytic infiltrates, and varying intensity of intracellular acid-fast positive bacilli. Enterocytes vacuolization and transepithelial elimination were also observed. Three cases were associated with cytomegalovirus and cryptococcal infections.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissues as a diagnostic aid for AIP.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted until February 2020. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. A random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio and other measures of accuracy.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":The meta-analysis included 20 studies comprising 346 patients with AIP and 590 patients with other pancreatobiliary diseases, including 371 pancreatobiliary malignancies. The summary estimates for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls were as follows: diagnostic odds ratio 38.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 18.70-80.75); sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI, 0.59-0.69); specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.95). The area under the curve was 0.939 for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy according to control groups (pancreatobiliary cancer versus other chronic pancreatitis) and sampling site (pancreas versus bile duct/ampulla).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Current data demonstrate that IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissue has a high specificity but moderate sensitivity for diagnosing AIP. IgG4 immunostaining may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of AIP when AIP is clinically suspected, but a combination of imaging and serology does not provide a conclusive diagnosis.",eng,Pancreatology,100966936,1424-3903,ppublish,33060017,10.1016/j.pan.2020.10.028,20,8,Pancreatology
