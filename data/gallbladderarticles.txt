33261560,2020,12,1471-2407,BMC cancer,Immunoproteomics approach revealed elevated autoantibody levels against ANXA1 in early stage gallbladder carcinoma.,10.1186/s12885-020-07676-6,"Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":Early diagnosis is important for the timely treatment of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) patients and may lead to increased survival outcomes. Here, we have applied serological proteome analysis (SERPA), an immunoproteomics approach, for the detection of 'tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that elicit humoral response' in early stage GBC patients.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Total protein from pooled tumor tissue of GBC patients (n = 7) was resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by immunoblotting using pooled blood plasma from healthy volunteers (n = 11) or gallstone disease (GSD) cases (n = 11) or early stage GBC (Stage I and II) (n = 5) or GBC stage IIIA (n = 9). 2-D gel and immunoblot images were acquired and analyzed using PDQuest software to identify immunoreactive spots in GBC cases in comparison to controls. Proteins from immunoreactive spots were identified by liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometric analysis (LC-MS/MS). Autoantibody levels for two of the functionally relevant proteins were investigated in individual plasma samples (52 cases and 89 controls) by dot blot assay using recombinant proteins.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Image analysis using PDQuest software identified 25 protein spots with significantly high or specific immunoreactivity in GBC cases. Mass spectrometric analysis of 8 corresponding protein spots showing intense immunoreactivity (based on densitometric analysis) in early stage GBC or GBC stage IIIA cases led to the identification of 27 proteins. Some of the identified proteins include ANXA1, HSPD1, CA1, CA2, ALDOA and CTSD. Among the two proteins, namely ANXA1 and HSPD1 verified using a cohort of samples, significantly elevated autoantibody levels against ANXA1 were observed in early stage GBC cases in comparison to healthy volunteers or GSD cases (unpaired t-test, p &lt; 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for ANXA1 showed an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0.69, with 41.7% sensitivity against a specificity of 89.9% for early stage GBC. IHC analysis for ANXA1 protein showed 'high' expression levels in 72% of GBC cases whereas all the controls showed 'low' expression levels.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The study suggests that the ANXA1 autoantibody levels against ANXA1 may be potentially employed for early stage detection of GBC patients. Other proteins could also be explored and verified in a large cohort of clinical samples.",eng,BMC Cancer,100967800,1471-2407,epublish,33261560,10.1186/s12885-020-07676-6,20,1,BMC Cancer

The natural history of ICPN is unknown. Here, we report a case of ICPN, highlighting its natural course.                 Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 79-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with perforated cholecystitis. After percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, due to the presence of surgical risk factors, we opted to perform gallstone removal through percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy instead of cholecystectomy. ICPN, which was accidentally detected after the removal of the gallbladder stones, was also endoscopically removed. After 4 years, the patient came back to the hospital with a large gallbladder mass. After cholecystectomy, pathological examination revealed ICPN with invasive adenocarcinoma.

33225924,2020,11,1471-2407,BMC cancer,Modification of the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for gallbladder carcinoma to improve prognostic precision.,10.1186/s12885-020-07578-7,"Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) came into force since 2018. However, the prognostic precision of this staging system has not been properly assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the latest staging system and suggest modifications to improve its prognostic precision.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Data of patients with GBC was included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2015) and multicenter database (2010-2017). Baseline clinicopathologic characteristics were recorded including age, sex, race, grade, T category, N category, M category and stage. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival functions. The prediction power of the AJCC 8th edition and its modified version were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 2779 GBC patients were included in the SEER database and 591 were collected from multicenter database. While no significant difference in survival of patients was observed between stages IVA and IVB using the 8th AJCC staging system (p &gt; 0.05), the prognosis of stage IIIA showed a slightly better outcome than stage IIIB (p = 0.046) in the SEER database. In the multicenter database, there was no significant difference between stage IIIA and stage IIIB (p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, no significant difference in the survival of patients between stages IIIA and IIIB was observed when M0 patients with at least 6 lymph nodes (LNs) were analyzed (p &gt; 0.05) for both SEER and multicenter database. On the other hand, a modified staging system was able to stratify patients from stage IIIA, stage IIIB and stage IV (p &lt; 0.001). For the SEER database, the C-indexes of 8th AJCC staging system and that of its modified version were 0.709 and 0.742, respectively. For the multicenter database, the C-index of 8th AJCC staging system and that of our modified version were 0.635 and 0.679, respectively.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The modified 8th staging system proposed in this study can improve the prognostic precision of the 8th AJCC staging system for GBC. We therefore suggest including these modifications in the next update of AJCC staging system for GBC.",eng,BMC Cancer,100967800,1471-2407,epublish,33225924,10.1186/s12885-020-07578-7,20,1,BMC Cancer

Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":PBM (anomalous union of common bile duct and pancreatic duct) is mostly regarded as an Asian-only disorder, with 200X risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC), attributed to reflux of pancreatic enzymes.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Radiologic images of 840 patients in the U.S. who underwent pancreatobiliary resections were reviewed for PBM and contrasted with 171 GBC cases from Japan.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Eight % of the US GBCs (24/300) had PBM (similar to Japan; 15/171, 8.8%), in addition to 1/42 bile duct carcinomas and 5/33 choledochal cysts. None of the 30 PBM cases from the US had been diagnosed as PBM in the original work-up. PBM was not found in other pancreatobiliary disorders. Clinicopathologic features of the 39 PBM-associated GBCs (US:24, Japan:15) were similar; however, comparison with non-PBM GBCs revealed that they occurred predominantly in females (F/M = 3); at younger (&lt;50-year-old) age (21% vs. 6.5% in non-PBM GBCs; p = 0.01); were uncommonly associated with gallstones (14% vs. 58%; p &lt; 0.001); had higher rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (69% vs. 44%; p = 0.04); arose more often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.02); and had a higher proportion of non-conventional carcinomas (21% vs. 7%; p = 0.03).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":PBM accounts for 8% of GBCs also in the West but is typically undiagnosed. PBM-GBCs tend to manifest in younger age and often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to unusual carcinoma types. If PBM is encountered, cholecystectomy and surveillance of bile ducts is warranted. PBM-associated GBCs offer an invaluable model for variant anatomy-induced chemical (reflux-related) carcinogenesis.",eng,Ann Surg,0372354,0003-4932,aheadofprint,33201123,10.1097/SLA.0000000000004482,NA,NA,Ann Surg
33129276,2020,10,1471-230X,BMC gastroenterology,Changes in plasma bile acids are associated with gallbladder stones and polyps.,10.1186/s12876-020-01512-8,"Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"":The development of gallbladder disease (GBD) is related to bile acid (BA) metabolism, and the rate of BA circulation increases the risk of biliary cancer. However, it is unclear whether patterns of circulating bile acids (BAs) change in patients with benign GBDs such as gallbladder stones and polyps. Herein, we compared and characterised plasma BA profiles in patients with cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps with healthy controls, and explored relationships between plasma BA profiles, demographics, and laboratory test indices.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A total of 330 subjects (13 healthy controls, 292 cholecystolithiasis and 25 non-neoplastic polyps) were recruited and plasma BA profiles including 14 metabolites from patients with pathologically confirmed cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps were compared with controls. BAs were quantitated by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and statistical and regression analyses of demographics and laboratory test indices were performed.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Females displayed a higher burden of GBD than males (63.36% cholecystolithiasis, 60% non-neoplastic polyps). Cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps were associated with increased plasma total secondary BAs, while levels of primary BAs were lower than in healthy controls. Plasma ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), glycyurdeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were decreased significantly in GBDs, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was negatively correlated with white blood cell count and neutrophil percentage.

In this study, 19 examples of a poorly characterized phenomenon, mural papillary mucinous lesions that arise in adenomyomatous nodules and form localized ICNs, were analyzed. Two of these were identified in 1750 consecutive cholecystectomies reviewed specifically for this purpose, placing its incidence at 0.1%. Median age was 68 years. Unlike other gallbladder lesions, these were slightly more common in men (female/male=0.8), and 55% had documented cholelithiasis. All were characterized by a compact multilocular, demarcated, cystic lesion with papillary proliferations and mucinous epithelial lining. The lesions' architecture, distribution, location, and typical size were suggestive of evolution from an underlying adenomyomatous nodule. All had gastric/endocervical-like mucinous epithelium, but 5 also had a focal intestinal-like epithelium. Cytologic atypia was graded as 1 to 3 and defined as 1A: mucinous, without cytoarchitectural atypia (n=3), 1B: mild (n=7), 2: moderate (n=2), and 3: severe atypia (n=7, 3 of which also had invasive carcinoma, 16%). Background gallbladder mucosal involvement was absent in all but 2 cases, both of which had multifocal papillary mucosal nodules. In conclusion, these cases highlight a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, mural ICNs arising in adenomyomatous nodules, which, by essentially sparing the &quot;main&quot; mucosa, not displaying &quot;field-effect/defect&quot; phenomenon, and only rarely (16%) showing carcinomatous transformation, are analogous to pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.",eng,Am J Surg Pathol,7707904,0147-5185,ppublish,33060404,10.1097/PAS.0000000000001603,44,12,Am J Surg Pathol

In this study, We analyzed its expression in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and explored its relation with survival outcome. 122 patients were enrolled in the study, including 60 cases of GI-NETs, 24 cases of primary hepatic NETs (PHNETs), 16 cases of gallbladder NETs (GBNETs) and 22 cases of pancreatic NETs (pNETs). IHC was performed for DCLK1 on tumor tissue. All patients underwent a baseline visit, histologic determination, and a follow-up for survival. In the 60 cases of GI-NETs, DCLK1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic expression. The positive rates of DCLK1, Syn and CgA were 100% (60/60), 100% (60/60) and 36.7% (22/60), respectively. However, DCLK1 showed negative staining in all of the 62 cases of PHNETs, GBNETs, and pNETs. The mean score of DCLK1, Syn, and CgA were (5.77±2.012), (5.13±2.078) and (2.68±2.797), respectively. DCLK1 was correlated with primary site (P&lt;0.001) and Syn expression (P = 0.045). Additionally, in GI-NETs, we found that DCLK1 expression was associated with worse OS (log-rank = 5.212, P = 0.022). The divergent expression of DCLK1 in NETs suggests different functional roles of DCLK1 in different locations of NET within the digestive system. However, with the limited number of tumor samples, its outcome prediciton still needs further investigation.
