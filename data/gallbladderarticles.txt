Here, we have applied serological proteome analysis (SERPA), an immunoproteomics approach, for the detection of 'tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that elicit humoral response' in early stage GBC patients.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Total protein from pooled tumor tissue of GBC patients (n = 7) was resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by immunoblotting using pooled blood plasma from healthy volunteers (n = 11) or gallstone disease (GSD) cases (n = 11) or early stage GBC (Stage I and II) (n = 5) or GBC stage IIIA (n = 9). 2-D gel and immunoblot images were acquired and analyzed using PDQuest software to identify immunoreactive spots in GBC cases in comparison to controls. Proteins from immunoreactive spots were identified by liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometric analysis (LC-MS/MS). Autoantibody levels for two of the functionally relevant proteins were investigated in individual plasma samples (52 cases and 89 controls) by dot blot assay using recombinant proteins.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Image analysis using PDQuest software identified 25 protein spots with significantly high or specific immunoreactivity in GBC cases. Mass spectrometric analysis of 8 corresponding protein spots showing intense immunoreactivity (based on densitometric analysis) in early stage GBC or GBC stage IIIA cases led to the identification of 27 proteins. Some of the identified proteins include ANXA1, HSPD1, CA1, CA2, ALDOA and CTSD. Among the two proteins, namely ANXA1 and HSPD1 verified using a cohort of samples, significantly elevated autoantibody levels against ANXA1 were observed in early stage GBC cases in comparison to healthy volunteers or GSD cases (unpaired t-test, p &lt; 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for ANXA1 showed an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0.69, with 41.7% sensitivity against a specificity of 89.9% for early stage GBC. IHC analysis for ANXA1 protein showed 'high' expression levels in 72% of GBC cases whereas all the controls showed 'low' expression levels.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The study suggests that the ANXA1 autoantibody levels against ANXA1 may be potentially employed for early stage detection of GBC patients. Other proteins could also be explored and verified in a large cohort of clinical samples.",eng,BMC Cancer,100967800,1471-2407,epublish,33261560,10.1186/s12885-020-07676-6,20,1,BMC Cancer

Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A 79-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with perforated cholecystitis. After percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage, due to the presence of surgical risk factors, we opted to perform gallstone removal through percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy instead of cholecystectomy. ICPN, which was accidentally detected after the removal of the gallbladder stones, was also endoscopically removed. After 4 years, the patient came back to the hospital with a large gallbladder mass.

However, the prognostic precision of this staging system has not been properly assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the latest staging system and suggest modifications to improve its prognostic precision.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Data of patients with GBC was included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2015) and multicenter database (2010-2017). Baseline clinicopathologic characteristics were recorded including age, sex, race, grade, T category, N category, M category and stage. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival functions. The prediction power of the AJCC 8th edition and its modified version were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 2779 GBC patients were included in the SEER database and 591 were collected from multicenter database. While no significant difference in survival of patients was observed between stages IVA and IVB using the 8th AJCC staging system (p &gt; 0.05), the prognosis of stage IIIA showed a slightly better outcome than stage IIIB (p = 0.046) in the SEER database. In the multicenter database, there was no significant difference between stage IIIA and stage IIIB (p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, no significant difference in the survival of patients between stages IIIA and IIIB was observed when M0 patients with at least 6 lymph nodes (LNs) were analyzed (p &gt; 0.05) for both SEER and multicenter database. On the other hand, a modified staging system was able to stratify patients from stage IIIA, stage IIIB and stage IV (p &lt; 0.001). For the SEER database, the C-indexes of 8th AJCC staging system and that of its modified version were 0.709 and 0.742, respectively. For the multicenter database, the C-index of 8th AJCC staging system and that of our modified version were 0.635 and 0.679, respectively.

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Radiologic images of 840 patients in the U.S. who underwent pancreatobiliary resections were reviewed for PBM and contrasted with 171 GBC cases from Japan.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Eight % of the US GBCs (24/300) had PBM (similar to Japan; 15/171, 8.8%), in addition to 1/42 bile duct carcinomas and 5/33 choledochal cysts. None of the 30 PBM cases from the US had been diagnosed as PBM in the original work-up. PBM was not found in other pancreatobiliary disorders. Clinicopathologic features of the 39 PBM-associated GBCs (US:24, Japan:15) were similar; however, comparison with non-PBM GBCs revealed that they occurred predominantly in females (F/M = 3); at younger (&lt;50-year-old) age (21% vs. 6.5% in non-PBM GBCs; p = 0.01); were uncommonly associated with gallstones (14% vs. 58%; p &lt; 0.001); had higher rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (69% vs. 44%; p = 0.04); arose more often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.02); and had a higher proportion of non-conventional carcinomas (21% vs. 7%; p = 0.03).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":PBM accounts for 8% of GBCs also in the West but is typically undiagnosed. PBM-GBCs tend to manifest in younger age and often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to unusual carcinoma types.

However, it is unclear whether patterns of circulating bile acids (BAs) change in patients with benign GBDs such as gallbladder stones and polyps. Herein, we compared and characterised plasma BA profiles in patients with cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps with healthy controls, and explored relationships between plasma BA profiles, demographics, and laboratory test indices.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A total of 330 subjects (13 healthy controls, 292 cholecystolithiasis and 25 non-neoplastic polyps) were recruited and plasma BA profiles including 14 metabolites from patients with pathologically confirmed cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps were compared with controls. BAs were quantitated by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and statistical and regression analyses of demographics and laboratory test indices were performed.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Females displayed a higher burden of GBD than males (63.36% cholecystolithiasis, 60% non-neoplastic polyps). Cholecystolithiasis and non-neoplastic polyps were associated with increased plasma total secondary BAs, while levels of primary BAs were lower than in healthy controls. Plasma ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), glycyurdeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were decreased significantly in GBDs, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was negatively correlated with white blood cell count and neutrophil percentage.

In this study, 19 examples of a poorly characterized phenomenon, mural papillary mucinous lesions that arise in adenomyomatous nodules and form localized ICNs, were analyzed. Two of these were identified in 1750 consecutive cholecystectomies reviewed specifically for this purpose, placing its incidence at 0.1%. Median age was 68 years. Unlike other gallbladder lesions, these were slightly more common in men (female/male=0.8), and 55% had documented cholelithiasis. All were characterized by a compact multilocular, demarcated, cystic lesion with papillary proliferations and mucinous epithelial lining. The lesions' architecture, distribution, location, and typical size were suggestive of evolution from an underlying adenomyomatous nodule. All had gastric/endocervical-like mucinous epithelium, but 5 also had a focal intestinal-like epithelium. Cytologic atypia was graded as 1 to 3 and defined as 1A: mucinous, without cytoarchitectural atypia (n=3), 1B: mild (n=7), 2: moderate (n=2), and 3: severe atypia (n=7, 3 of which also had invasive carcinoma, 16%). Background gallbladder mucosal involvement was absent in all but 2 cases, both of which had multifocal papillary mucosal nodules. In conclusion, these cases highlight a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, mural ICNs arising in adenomyomatous nodules, which, by essentially sparing the &quot;main&quot; mucosa, not displaying &quot;field-effect/defect&quot; phenomenon, and only rarely (16%) showing carcinomatous transformation, are analogous to pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.",eng,Am J Surg Pathol,7707904,0147-5185,ppublish,33060404,10.1097/PAS.0000000000001603,44,12,Am J Surg Pathol

Abdominal ultrasound confirmed an oedematous intestinal loop in a 70-mm-long hernial sac, with no circulation detected. Abdominal X-ray showed no signs of passage disorder. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were elevated, and hepatic enzymes were normal in the laboratory findings. Exploration was performed via an inguinal incision on the right side, an uncertain cystic structure was found in the hernial sac, and several small abnormal masses were palpated there.

TB has been considered a strong prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer. The International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC) scoring system is the standardized method used for patient outcome prediction in several human tumors. We investigated the clinicopathological implications and applicability of TB measured using the ITBCC scoring system in gallbladder cancer (GBC).

33411027,2021,1,1432-2307,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,T2 gallbladder cancer shows substantial survival variation between continents and this is not due to histopathologic criteria or pathologic sampling differences.,10.1007/s00428-020-02968-5,"Published data on survival of T2 gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) from different countries show a wide range of 5-year survival rates from 30-&gt; 70%. Recently, studies have demonstrated substantial variation between countries in terms of their approach to sampling gallbladders, and furthermore, that pathologists from different continents apply highly variable criteria in determining stage of invasion in this organ. These findings raised the question of whether these variations in pathologic evaluation could account for the vastly different survival rates of T2 GBC reported in the literature. In this study, survival of 316 GBCs from three countries (Chile n = 137, South Korea n = 105, USA n = 74), all adequately sampled (with a minimum of five tumor sections examined) and histopathologically verified as pT2 (after consensus examination by expert pathologists from three continents), was analyzed. Chilean patients had a significantly worse prognosis based on 5-year all-cause mortality (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.83, p = 0.002) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.51-3.84, p &lt; 0.001), compared to their South Korean counterparts, even when controlled for age and sex. Comparing the USA to South Korea, the survival differences in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75, p = 0.015) and disease-specific mortality (HR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.14-3.31, p = 0.015) were also pronounced. The 3-year disease-specific survival rates in South Korea, the USA, and Chile were 75%, 65%, and 55%, respectively, the 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 60%, 50%, and 50%, respectively, and the overall 5-year survival rates were 55%, 45%, and 35%, respectively. In conclusion, the survival of true T2 GBC in properly classified cases is neither as good nor as bad as previously documented in the literature and shows notable geographic differences even in well-sampled cases with consensus histopathologic criteria. Future studies should focus on other potential reasons including biologic, etiopathogenetic, management-related, populational, or healthcare practice-related factors that may influence the survival differences of T2 GBC in different regions.",eng,Virchows Arch,9423843,0945-6317,aheadofprint,33411027,10.1007/s00428-020-02968-5,NA,NA,Virchows Arch

The majority of NENs are represented by neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), while neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are extremely rare in this location. Occasionally, NEN may present as a part of a mixed neoplasm, with a coexisting non-neuroendocrine component. The latest World Health Organization classification denotes these lesions as mixed neuroendocrine-non-NENs (MiNENs). A novel type of MiNEN, the mixed adenoma well-differentiated NET (MANET), has been increasingly recognized and reported. In such lesions, a dysplastic noninvasive neoplasm and a NET represent the exocrine and endocrine component, respectively. MANETs have mostly been identified in the colon, small intestines, and stomach. In this article, we report, we believe, the first case of mixed gallbladder neoplasm with both biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) and NET components, which may be regarded as a variant of MANET. Given the expectably favorable prognoses of MANETs, it is imperative not to misdiagnose the infiltrative yet indolent neuroendocrine component as an invasive adenocarcinoma or a NEC.",eng,Int J Surg Pathol,9314927,1066-8969,aheadofprint,33423570,10.1177/1066896920986987,NA,NA,Int J Surg Pathol

Most of the cases usually present in late stage when prognosis is poor. That mandates a necessity for proper screening in these areas for gall bladder lesions. Tumor markers CA 19-9 and CA 125 have been studied in various GI cancers and may also help in the screening, diagnosis and evaluation of gall bladder carcinoma. Aims: To assess serum CA19-9 and serum CA125 in patients with gall bladder lesions and find out a cut off value for diagnosis of carcinoma gallbladder.                 Label=""Methods and Material"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":Study included 118 cases, with female: male ratio of 4:1.Out of it, 91 (77 %) cases were benign and 27 (23 %) were malignant. Patients' sera was collected and analyzed for CA19-9 and CA 125 by CMIA method.                 Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"":The Mean (SD) value of CA19-9 for benign and malignant cases was found to be 12.86 (17.54) and 625.35(186.52) U/ml. For CA 125 it was found to be 17.98(13.69) and 239.63(73.72) U/ml respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P&lt; 0.001). When Mean - 2SD value of malignant lesions were taken as cut off a value of CA 19-9 and CA 125 were found be 252.31 U/ml &amp; 92.19U/ml respectively, found to be significant to suggest /diagnose a case of carcinoma gall bladder along with clinicoradiological findings.

Paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction (PLR) is a rare entity, occurring due to tumor cytokine secretion (typically granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]). We describe a case and aggregate results of previously published cases.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":We reviewed the English-language literature for all prior reports of PLR, recording age, gender, histologic diagnosis, WBC count, G-CSF level, and overall survival. We analyzed clinicopathologic variables' impact on survival.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":We identified 179 cases (mean age 64; 72 % M). Adeno-, squamous cell, sarcomatoid, and undifferentiated carcinomas accounted for &gt;70 %. Esophagus, gallbladder, lung, liver, and pancreas were the most common primaries. At time of publication 81 % of patients had died, with mean overall survival of 4 months. There was no correlation between WBC count and G-CSF level. On univariate analysis, WBC count was the only variable associated with survival (P = 0.03). Patients with WBC counts &gt;100 K/μL were twice as likely to die as those with counts from 11 K to 40 K/μL.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":PLR, typically carcinoma-associated, is characterized by dismal prognosis. The WBC count is inversely related to survival. Knowledge of this phenomenon militates against protracted, expensive work ups. In malignant neoplasms with prominent neutrophilic stroma, the pathologist should correlate with the WBC count and, if markedly elevated (&gt;40 K/μL), raise consideration for PLR.",eng,Pathol Res Pract,7806109,0344-0338,ppublish,33341546,10.1016/j.prp.2020.153295,217,NA,Pathol Res Pract

Explosive growth in the number of CF animal models has also occurred over this time span, clarifying CF disease pathophysiology and creating opportunities to understand more complex disease processes associated with an aging CF population. This review focuses on the CF-associated pathologies of the gastrointestinal system and how animal models have increased our understanding of this complex multisystemic disease. Although CF is primarily recognized as a pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal pathology occurs very commonly and can affect the quality of life for these patients. Furthermore, we discuss how next-generation genetic engineering of larger animal models will impact the field's understanding of CF disease pathophysiology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",eng,Annu Rev Pathol,101275111,1553-4006,ppublish,33497264,10.1146/annurev-pathol-022420-105133,16,NA,Annu Rev Pathol

Surgery is the cornerstone of cure; the optimal approach depends on the anatomical site of the primary tumour and the best outcomes are achieved through management by specialist multidisciplinary teams. Unfortunately, most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Most studies in advanced disease have pooled the various subtypes of biliary tract cancer by necessity to achieve adequate sample sizes; however, differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, natural history, surgical therapy, response to treatment, and prognosis have long been recognised. Additionally, the identification of distinct patient subgroups harbouring unique molecular alterations with corresponding targeted therapies (such as isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutations and fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 fusions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, among others) is changing the treatment paradigm.
