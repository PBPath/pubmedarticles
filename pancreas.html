<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Mesothelin (MSLN) is a GPI-linked tumor antigen overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including ovarian, pancreatic, lung and triple-negative breast cancer. Early signs of clinical efficacy with MSLN-targeting agents have validated MSLN as a promising target for therapeutic intervention, but therapies with improved efficacy are still needed to address the significant, unmet medical need posed by MSLN-expressing cancers. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We designed HPN536, a 53-kDa, trispecific, T cell-activating protein-based construct (TriTAC), which binds to MSLN-expressing tumor cells, CD3ε on T cells and to serum albumin. Experiments were conducted to assess the potency, activity and half-life of HPN536 in in vitro assays, rodent models and in non-human primates. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:HPN536 binds to MSLN-expressing tumor cells and to CD3ε on T cells leading to T cell activation and potent redirected target cell lysis. A third domain of HPN536 binds to serum albumin for extension of plasma half-life.

<p><em>Long term follow-up of a simplified and less burdened pancreatic duct ligation model of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in Goettingen Minipigs. BMC gastroenterology 2020 11;20(1)</em></p>
<p>PubMed: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33256637" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33256637</a></p>
<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic duct ligation in a minipig model leads to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This allows the study of digestive processes and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. However, detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure, perioperative management, a determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are scarce in the literature. Data of the long-term health status of minipigs upon EPI induction are still not available. Therefore, the present study describes in detail an experimental approach to the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency via pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs and the long term follow up of the animal’s health state. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:14 Goettingen minipigs underwent pancreatic duct ligation via midline laparotomy for the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal fat content, fat absorption, chymotrypsin levels, body weight and blood vitamin and glucose levels were determined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was successfully induced in 12 Goettingen minipigs. Two minipigs failed to develop exocrine insufficiency most likely due to undetected accessory pancreatic ducts. All animals tolerated the procedure very well and gained weight within 8 weeks after surgery without requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The follow up for approx. 180 weeks showed a stable body weight and health state of the animals with normal blood glucose levels (Table 1). From approx. 130 weeks post pancreatic duct ligation, all animals were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes and vitamins resulting in blood concentrations almost within the reference range. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs is an excellent method of inducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is important to identify and ligate accessory pancreatic ducts since persistence of accessory ducts will lead to maintenance of exocrine pancreatic function. The EPI model caused no persistent side effects in the animals and has the potential to be used in long-term EPI studies with up to 100 weeks post-OP without supplementation with enzymes and vitamins.</p>

Our objective was to study the relationship between new onset diabetes (NODM) and progression in patients with low risk mucinous cysts. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We evaluated a prospectively maintained cohort of 442 patients with a suspected mucinous cyst without worrisome features (WF) or high-risk stigmata (HRS). Multivariable Cox models were developed for progression to WF and HRS, with diabetes status formulated as both time independent and dependent covariates. The adjusted cumulative risk of progression was calculated using the corrected group prognosis method. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The 5-year cumulative progression rates to WFs and HRS were 12.8 and 3.6%, respectively. After controlling for other risk factors, the development of NODM was strongly associated with progression to HRS (HR = 11.6; 95%CI, 3.5-57.7%), but not WF. Among patients with the smallest cysts (&lt;10 mm) at baseline, those who developed NODM had a 5-year adjusted cumulative risk of progression to HRS of 8.6% (95%CI, 0.0%-20.2%), compared to only 0.8% (95%CI, 0.0%-2.3%) for patients without NODM. Among patients with the largest cysts (20-29 mm), those who developed NODM during surveillance had a 5-year adjusted cumulative risk of progression of 53.5% (95%CI, 19.6%-89.9%) compared to only 7.5% (95%CI, 1.6%-15.2%) for patients without NODM.

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a world-wide pandemic since its onset in December of 2019. Although, a primary respiratory pathogen, over the ensuing period, its extra-pulmonary effects have come to the forefront. The virus, having multi-organ tropism, has been shown to affect a host of other organs beyond the lung, including the pancreas. The data on pancreatic involvement by COVID-19, however, have been limited. Moreover, whether the effects on the pancreas are due to the direct effects of the virus or is just an epi-phenomenon is debatable. The prevalence of pancreatic injury and degree of injury are the other issues that need to be addressed. Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and the management of the same in the COVID era needs to be tailored assessing the risk-benefit ratio for the same. Additionally, pancreatic surgery increases not only the morbidity of the patient, but also the risk of the operator and burden on the health care system. Hence, the decision for such major procedures needs to be rationalized for optimum benefit during this pandemic. Similarly, for the endoscopist, pancreatic endoscopy needs to be carefully regulated to reduce risk to both the patient and the physician and yet deliver optimum patient care. This review gives a concise summary of various aspects of pancreatic involvement and pancreatic disease management during this pandemic.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, cancer remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein (IGF2BP) family has been reported to be involved in a variety of human malignant tumours. However, little is known about their expression and prognostic value in human pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we performed a detailed cancer versus normal differential analysis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases were used to analyse the mRNA expression levels of the IGF2BP family in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Then, the LinkedOmics and GEPIA databases were used to assess the relation between the expression levels of IGF2BPs and overall survival (OS). Then, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed, and subgroups based on grade and stage were analysed. The signalling pathways associated with IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 were then investigated via gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 were associated with each subset of OS based on grade and stage. Further clinical correlation analysis of IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 confirmed that IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 are fundamental factors in promoting pancreatic cancer progression.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Surgical resection is the major way to cure pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, this operation is complex, and the peri-operative risk is high, making patients more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Therefore, establishing a risk model that predicts admission to ICU is meaningful in preventing patients from post-operation deterioration and potentially reducing socio-economic burden. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively collected 120 clinical features from 1242 PDAC patients, including demographic data, pre-operative and intra-operative blood tests, in-hospital duration, and ICU status. Machine learning pipelines, including Supporting Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Lasso Regression, were employed to choose an optimal model in predicting ICU admission. Ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and Lasso Regression were adopted in the correlation analysis of post-operative bleeding, total in-hospital duration, and discharge costs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:SVM model achieved higher performance than the other two models, resulted in an AU-ROC of 0.80. The features, such as age, duration of operation, monocyte count, and intra-operative partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), are risk factors in the ICU admission. The protective factors include RBC count, analgesic pump dexmedetomidine (DEX), and intra-operative maintenance of DEX. Basophil percentage, duration of the operation, and total infusion volume were risk variables for staying in ICU. The bilirubin, CA125, and pre-operative albumin were associated with the post-operative bleeding volume. The operation duration was the most important factor for discharge costs, while pre-lymphocyte percentage and the absolute count are responsible for less cost. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We observed that several new indicators such as DEX, monocyte count, basophil percentage, and intra-operative PaO2 showed a good predictive effect on the possibility of admission to ICU and duration of stay in ICU. This work provided an essential reference for indication in advance to PDAC operation.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is aggressive, with an overall five-year survival rate of 9%, and few patients are candidates for pancreatectomy at presentation. The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Due to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT, and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. 118 resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were selected from the cases between 2011-2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes. There were statistically significant differences for dystrophic calcification, eosinophilic tumor cell changes, elastotic stromal/vascular change, islet cell hyperplasia, and nerve hypertrophy between the two groups, with these features seen more frequently in NAT cases. Blue/grey stromal fibrosis was present in all cases regardless of NAT, except few complete regression cases and one treated case with intraneural invasion only. Blue/grey fibrosis is a useful histologic visual clue to suggest the possibility of adjacent tumor in the majority of PDAC cases regardless of NAT. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, neither grading scheme correlated with overall survival in our cohort. However, the MD Anderson score was significantly correlated with both time to primary tumor recurrence (p=0.002) and time to distant recurrence (p=0.04); while the modified Ryan score did not., Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is aggressive, with an overall five-year survival rate of 9%, and few patients are candidates for pancreatectomy at presentation. The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Owing to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. One hundred eighteen resections for PDAC were selected from the cases between 2011 and 2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson (MDA) score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Intractable serous (not chylous) ascites (IA) that infrequently develops early following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic cancer is a life-threatening problem. The relationship between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) for pancreatic cancer and the incidence of IA following PD has not been evaluated. This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with IA that develops early after PD for pancreatic cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively identified 94 patients who underwent PD for pancreatic cancer at the Department of General and Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka Medical College Hospital, Osaka, Japan, from April 2012 to March 2020. Data on 29 parameters were obtained from medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors. Levels of serum albumin were compared before and after NACRT to analyze its effect. Survival analysis was also conducted. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 92 patients included in this study, 8 (8.70%) were categorized into the IA group. Multivariate analysis identified NACRT [odds ratio (OR) 27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-394, p = 0.016)] and hypoalbuminemia (≤ 1.6 g/dl) just after the operation (OR 50, 95% CI 1.68-1516, p = 0.024) as risk factors. The level of serum albumin was significantly decreased following NACRT. The IA group had poorer prognosis than the control group. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:IA is a serious problem that aggravates patient’s prognosis. Postoperative lymphatic leak might be a trigger of IA. NACRT was a major risk factor, followed by hypoalbuminemia caused by various reasons. These factors may act synergistically and cause IA.</p>

<p>HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is a transcript produced from the antisense strand of the HOXC gene cluster and influencing expression of genes from the HOXD locus. HOTAIR has prominent roles in different aspects of carcinogenic process from cancer initiation to metastasis. A number of in vitro, in vivo and human investigations have confirmed the oncogenic impacts of HOTAIR. The diagnostic power of HOTAIR in distinguishing cancer status from healthy status has been optimal in gastric cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. The most important achievement in this regard has been provided by studies that verified diagnostic value of this lncRNA in the serum samples, potentiating its application in non-invasive diagnosis of cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR has a crucial role in determination of response of cancer cells to therapeutic modalities. The current review aims to explain the outlines of these studies to emphasize its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for these conditions.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to examine whether elevated in-hospital mortality rates in lower volume hospitals are only valid on average or also apply for individual hospitals. Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Various studies demonstrated a volume-outcome relationship in pancreatic surgery with increased mortality in low volume hospitals. However, almost all studies assessed quality indicators only for groups of hospitals by averaged measures, neglecting variability of hospital performance. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The German nationwide hospital discharge data (diagnosis-related groups-statistics) was used to determine risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality for all distal pancreatectomies (DP), pancreatoduodenectomies (Whipple-procedure, PD), and pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomies (PPD) performed between 2011 and 2015. Hospitals were stratified according to annual and 5-year total procedure volume and examined in relation to average in-hospital mortality of the highest volume quintile. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Lowest adjusted mortality rates were observed in highest volume quintiles for each pancreatic resection procedure, with 6.2% for DP, 8.3% for PD, and 5.7% for PPD in the 5-year observation period. With these mortality rates as reference values the analysis revealed that a non-negligible proportion of hospitals performed equal or better (DP: 430/784, 54.5%; PD: 269/611, 44.0%; PPD: 255/565, 45.1%) than the hospitals of the highest volume quintile. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:High quality of care, with in-hospital mortality rates less or equal to high-volume hospitals, is also achieved in hospitals with lesser procedure volume. Therefore, mere volume seems not suitable as proximal measure for assessing individual hospital quality. Instead, more sophisticated certification systems, that allow accurate quality assessment and better reflect clinical variability, should preferred to fixed minimum volume thresholds.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly used for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is unknown whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy (NCRT vs. NAC). We aim to compare pathological and survival outcomes of NCRT and NAC in patients with PDAC. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Single-center analysis of PDAC patients treated with NCRT or NAC followed by resection between December 2008 and December 2018 was performed. Average treatment effect (ATE) was estimated after case-control matching using Mahalanobis distance nearest-neighbor matching. Inverse probability weighted estimates (IPWE)-based ATE was estimated for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among the 418 patients (mean age 66.8 years, 51% female) included in the study, 327 received NAC and 91 received NCRT. NCRT patients had higher rates of locally advanced disease, number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles, more chemotherapy regimen crossover (gemcitabine and 5-FU based), and were more likely to undergo open surgical procedures and/or vascular resection (all p &lt; 0.05). After matched analysis, NCRT was associated with a significant reduction in lymph node positive disease [ATE = (-)0.24, p = 0.007] and lymphovascular invasion [ATE = (-)0.20, p = 0.02]. While NCRT was associated with significantly improved DFS by 9.5 months (p = 0.006), it did not affect OS by IPWE-based ATE after adjusting for adjuvant therapy (ATE = 5.5 months; p = 0.32). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Compared with NAC alone, NCRT is associated with improved pathologic surrogates and disease-free survival, but not overall survival in patients with PDAC.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Tumor size measurement is critical for accurate tumor staging in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, accurate tumor size measurement is challenging in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before resection, due to treatment-induced fibrosis and tumor invasion beyond the grossly identified tumor area. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the tumor size and tumor volume measured on post-therapy computed tomography (CT) scans and the pathological measurement. Also, we investigated the correlation between these measurements and clinicopathological parameters and survival. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Retrospectively, we evaluated 343 patients with PDAC who received neoadjuvant therapy, followed by pancreaticoduodenectomy and had pre-operative pancreatic protocol CT imaging. We measured the longest tumor diameter (RadL) and the radiological tumor volume (RadV) on the post-therapy CT scan, then we categorized RadL into four radiologic tumor stages (RTS) based on the current AJCC staging (8th edition) protocol and RadV based on the median. Pearson correlation or Spearman’s coefficient (δ), T-test and ANOVA was used to test the correlation between the radiological and pathological measurement. Chi-square analysis was used to test the correlation with the tumor pathological response, lymph-node metastasis and margin status and Kaplan-Meier and Cox-proportional hazard for survival analysis. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:As a continuous variable, RadL showed a positive linear correlation with the post-therapy pathologic tumor size in the overall patient population (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.72, P &lt; 0.001) and RadV (δ: 0.63, p &lt; 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between RadL and pathologic tumor size in patients with ypT0 and those with pathologic tumor size of ≤1.0 cm. Post-therapy RTS and RadV group correlated with ypT stage, tumor response grades using either CAP or MDA grading system, distance of superior mesenteric artery margin and tumor recurrence/metastasis. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Although RadL tends to understage ypT in PDAC patients who had no radiologically detectable tumor or small tumors (RTS0 or RTS1), radiologic measurement of post-therapy tumor size may be used as a marker for the pathologic tumor staging and tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy.</p>

Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients with solid pancreatic masses without cystic component &gt;20% on computed tomography scan, and without biliary metallic stents, or coagulation problems were included prospectively. Standard 22G needles were used (maximum four passes); each sample was paraffin-embedded and analyzed separately. Final diagnosis was established by EUS-FNA, repeat EUS-FNA, surgery, or follow-up. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Sixty-one of 65 patients were included. The final diagnoses were adenocarcinoma (n = 44, 72%), neuroendocrine tumor (NET) (n = 10, 16%), metastasis (n = 1, 4%) and nonmalignant lesion (n = 6, 10%). Immunohistochemical staining was possible in 17 cases. The diagnosis was established by the first pass in 62% of cases (n = 38), by the second in 15% (n = 9), by the third in 15% (n = 9), and by the fourth in 3% (n = 2). The diagnostic accuracy for all four passes compared to the first three passes was 95% vs 92% (P = .5). The contribution of the fourth pass was not different between adenocarcinoma and NET (2% vs 10%, respectively; P = .667). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Three passes with standard EUS-FNA was optimal for a specific diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses, regardless of the histological type of the lesion.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:An epidermoid cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen (ECIPAS) in the pancreas head is an extremely rare condition. The natural course of this condition is not well known, and it is difficult to diagnose before surgery due to the lack of specific imaging findings. Label=“CASE PRESENTATION” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A tumor was found in the head of the pancreas in a 68-year-old man with abdominal distension and discomfort. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested a malignant tumor, such as a colloid cancer. The tumor was removed surgically, with pathologic examination showing that it was an ECIPAS. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:ECIPAS cannot be easily distinguished from other pancreatic cystic tumors, making it necessary to include ECIPAS in the differential diagnosis of these tumors. Unnecessary surgical resection may be avoided by more accurate preoperative diagnosis based on clinical and imaging characteristics.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The transcription factor capicua (CIC) regulates mammalian development and homeostasis. Growing evidence shows that CIC suppresses various human cancers by directly repressing the downstream cancer-related target genes. This study investigated the clinical and biologic significance of CIC expression in pancreatic cancer (PC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The study reviewed 132 patients with PC who underwent curative resection. The patients were divided into two groups according to CIC immunoreactivity score by immunohistochemistry, and the associations between CIC expression, clinicopathologic characteristics, and postoperative prognosis were investigated. Moreover, the influence of CIC expression on the malignant potential of PC cells was assessed with cell proliferation, motility assays, and use of quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot on the downstream target genes of CIC in knockdown experiments. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The low-CIC expression group showed a higher proportion of lymphatic invasion (72.9% vs. 53.1%; p = 0.024), intrapancreatic neural invasion (94.1% vs. 81.3%; p = 0.021), and extrapancreatic plexus invasion (30.9% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.0006) than the high-CIC expression group as well as significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.0002) and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.0041) rates. Low CIC expression was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (p = 0.038). Pancreatic cancer cells with knockdown CIC significantly enhanced cell motilities and cell cycle progression, promoted expression levels of ETV4 and MMP-9, and induced EMT. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The study elucidated the association of low CIC expression with a poor prognosis for patients with PC and suggested that the CIC-ETV4-MMP-9 axis might control PC progression.</p>

<p><em>Variation in Surgical Spending Among the Highest Quality Hospitals for Cancer Surgery. Annals of surgery 2020 11;()</em></p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study evaluates the variation in spending by the highest-quality hospitals performing complex cancer surgery in the United States. Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:As mortality rates for high-risk cancer surgery have improved, increased attention has focused on other elements of quality, such as complications. However, high-value surgical care requires both high-quality care and cost savings. Therefore, understanding any residual cost variation among high-quality hospitals is essential in order to better direct efforts to achieve efficient, high-value care. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medicare beneficiaries age 65 to 99 who underwent surgery for pancreas, esophageal, lung, rectal, and colon cancer from 2014 to 2016 were identified. The highest-quality hospitals were identified as those in the quintile with the lowest risk- and reliability-adjusted serious complication rates for each operation. Within this cohort of high-quality hospitals, thirty-day total episode, index hospitalization, physician, postacute care, and readmission spending was analyzed. Logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the probability of postoperative outcomes and post-discharge resource utilization. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:43,007 Medicare patients underwent either pancreas, esophageal, lung, rectal, or colon resection for cancer at a hospital within the highest-quality quintile. Among the highest quality hospitals, total episode spending ranged from $18,712 for colectomy to $38,054 for esophagectomy. Spending between the lowest- and highest spending hospitals varied from $1,207 (CI95% $1,195 to $1,220) or 6.6% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for colectomy to $5,706 (CI95% $5,506 to $5,906) or 16.1% of total episode spending in the lowest tertile for esophagectomy. The largest component of variation was from postacute care spending followed by readmission. For all operations the risk-adjusted rate of postacute care facility utilization was lower among the lowest spending hospitals compared to the highest spending hospitals. For example, for pancreas the lowest-spending hospitals on average discharged patients to a postacute care facility at a rate of 18,6% (CI95% 16.2 to 20.9) compared to 31.0% (CI95% 28.2 to 33.9) in the highest-spending hospitals. In all operations, the risk-adjusted readmission rate was lower among the lowest-spending hospitals compared to the highest-spending hospitals. For instance, within the esophagus cohort, the lowest-spending hospitals had an average risk-adjusted readmission rate of 17.3% compared to 29.4% in the highest spending hospitals (p &lt; 0.001). Label=“CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Even among the highest-quality hospitals, significant cost variation persists among cancer operations. Post-acute care variation, rather than residual variation in complication rates, explains the majority of this variation and represents an immediately actionable target for increased cost efficiency.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study aimed to identify risk factors for recurrence after pancreatic resection for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Long-term follow-up data on recurrence after surgical resection for IPMN are currently lacking. Previous studies have presented mixed results on the role of margin status in risk of recurrence after surgical resection. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 126 patients that underwent resection for noninvasive IPMN were followed for a median of 9.5 years. Dedicated pathological and radiological reviews were performed to correlate clinical and pathological features (including detailed pathological features of the parenchymal margin) with recurrence after surgical resection. In addition, in a subset of 32 patients with positive margins, we determined the relationship between the margin and original IPMN using driver gene mutations identified by next-generation sequencing. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Family history of pancreatic cancer and high-grade IPMN was identified as risk factors for recurrence in both uni- and multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 3.05 and 1.88, respectively). Although positive margin was not significantly associated with recurrence in our cohort, the size and grade of the dysplastic focus at the margin were significantly correlated with recurrence in margin-positive patients. Genetic analyses showed that the neoplastic epithelium at the margin was independent from the original IPMN in at least 9 of 32 cases (28%). The majority of recurrences (74%) occurred after 3 years, and a significant minority (32%) occurred after 5 years. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Sustained postoperative surveillance for all patients is indicated, particularly those with risk factors such has family history and high-grade dysplasia.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:A soft remnant texture of the pancreas is commonly accepted as a risk factor for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). However, its assessment is subjective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of intraoperative amylase level of the pancreatic juice as a risk factor of POPF after PD. Label=“METHOD” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This study included 75 patients who underwent PD between November 2014 and April 2020 at Jikei University Hospital. We investigated the relationship between pancreatic texture, intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice, results of the pathological evaluations, and the incidence of POPF. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Twenty-three patients (31%) developed POPF. The significant predictors of POPF were non-ductal adenocarcinoma (p &lt; 0.01), soft pancreatic remnant (p &lt; 0.01), high intraoperative blood loss (p &lt; 0.01), high intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice (p &lt; 0.01), and low pancreatic fibrosis (p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that the significant independent predictors of POPF were high intraoperative blood loss (p &lt; 0.01) and high intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice (p = 0.02). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the cut-off value for the intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice was 2.17 × 105 IU/L (area under the curve = 0.726, sensitivity = 95.7%, and specificity = 50.0%) CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative amylase level of pancreatic juice is a reliable objective predictor for POPF after PD.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Chemotherapy dose modification to manage adverse events is commonplace in clinical practice. This exploratory analysis evaluates the impact of liposomal irinotecan dose modification on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in the NAPOLI-1 clinical trial (NCT01494506). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Analysis includes only patients enrolled under protocol version 2 who received at least the first 2 scheduled doses of study drug. Within the liposomal irinotecan +5 fluorouracil/leucovorin (5 FU/LV) arm, patients were grouped according to whether or not they had a dose modification within the first 6 weeks. Dose reduction was defined as any decrease from initial dose; dose delay was any dosing delay &gt;3 days from target date. OS and PFS (Kaplan-Meier estimates) were compared within the liposomal irinotecan+5-FU/LV arm and between treatment arms. Unstratified hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 93 patients from the liposomal irinotecan+5 FU/LV arm included in the analysis, 53 experienced a dose modification (both delay and reduction, n = 30; delay only, n = 19; reduction only, n = 4). No apparent difference in median OS or PFS was observed between patients who did versus patients who did not have a dose modification (OS: 8.4 vs 6.7 months; HR, 0.89; PFS: 4.2 vs 3.1 months; HR, 0.74). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:An early dose reduction or delay of liposomal irinotecan+5-FU/LV in the first 6 weeks does not significantly impact OS or PFS compared to patients without dose modifications. This finding suggests that tolerability-guided dose modification of liposomal irinotecan does not adversely affect efficacy outcomes.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND”:Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive loss of pancreatic beta cells. Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody specific for tumor necrosis factor α that has already been approved for the treatment of several autoimmune conditions in adults and children. Whether golimumab could preserve beta-cell function in youth with newly diagnosed overt (stage 3) type 1 diabetes is unknown. Label=“METHODS”:In this phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, children and young adults (age range, 6 to 21 years) with newly diagnosed overt type 1 diabetes to receive subcutaneous golimumab or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was endogenous insulin production, as assessed according to the area under the concentration-time curve for C-peptide level in response to a 4-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (4-hour C-peptide AUC) at week 52. Secondary and additional end points included insulin use, the glycated hemoglobin level, the number of hypoglycemic events, the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide over time, and response profile. Label=“RESULTS”:A total of 84 participants underwent randomization - 56 were assigned to the golimumab group and 28 to the placebo group. The mean (±SD) 4-hour C-peptide AUC at week 52 differed significantly between the golimumab group and the placebo group (0.64±0.42 pmol per milliliter vs. 0.43±0.39 pmol per milliliter, P&lt;0.001). A treat-to-target approach led to good glycemic control in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the groups in glycated hemoglobin level. Insulin use was lower with golimumab than with placebo. A partial-remission response (defined as an insulin dose-adjusted glycated hemoglobin level score [calculated as the glycated hemoglobin level plus 4 times the insulin dose] of ≤9) was observed in 43% of participants in the golimumab group and in 7% of those in the placebo group (difference, 36 percentage points; 95% CI, 22 to 55). The mean number of hypoglycemic events did not differ between the trial groups. Hypoglycemic events that were recorded as adverse events at the discretion of investigators were reported in 13 participants (23%) in the golimumab group and in 2 (7%) of those in the placebo group. Antibodies to golimumab were detected in 30 participants who received the drug; 29 had antibody titers lower than 1:1000, of whom 12 had positive results for neutralizing antibodies. Label=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among children and young adults with newly diagnosed overt type 1 diabetes, golimumab resulted in better endogenous insulin production and less exogenous insulin use than placebo.

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To determine the associations of pancreatobiliary maljunction (PBM) in the West. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:PBM (anomalous union of common bile duct and pancreatic duct) is mostly regarded as an Asian-only disorder, with 200X risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC), attributed to reflux of pancreatic enzymes. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Radiologic images of 840 patients in the U.S. who underwent pancreatobiliary resections were reviewed for PBM and contrasted with 171 GBC cases from Japan. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Eight % of the US GBCs (24/300) had PBM (similar to Japan; 15/171, 8.8%), in addition to 1/42 bile duct carcinomas and 5/33 choledochal cysts. None of the 30 PBM cases from the US had been diagnosed as PBM in the original work-up. PBM was not found in other pancreatobiliary disorders. Clinicopathologic features of the 39 PBM-associated GBCs (US:24, Japan:15) were similar; however, comparison with non-PBM GBCs revealed that they occurred predominantly in females (F/M = 3); at younger (&lt;50-year-old) age (21% vs. 6.5% in non-PBM GBCs; p = 0.01); were uncommonly associated with gallstones (14% vs. 58%; p &lt; 0.001); had higher rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (69% vs. 44%; p = 0.04); arose more often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.02); and had a higher proportion of non-conventional carcinomas (21% vs. 7%; p = 0.03). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PBM accounts for 8% of GBCs also in the West but is typically undiagnosed. PBM-GBCs tend to manifest in younger age and often through adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to unusual carcinoma types. If PBM is encountered, cholecystectomy and surveillance of bile ducts is warranted. PBM-associated GBCs offer an invaluable model for variant anatomy-induced chemical (reflux-related) carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To define frequencies, pattern of progression (invasive versus non-invasive), and risk factors of progression of resected non-invasive IPMNs BACKGROUND:: There is a risk of progression in the remnant pancreas after resection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:449 consecutive patients with resected IPMNs from 1995-2018 were included to the study. Patients with invasive carcinoma or with follow-up &lt; 6 months were excluded. Non-invasive progression was defined as a new IPMN, increased main pancreatic duct (MPD) size, and increased size of an existing lesion (5 mm compared to preoperative imaging). Invasive progression was defined as development of invasive cancer in the remnant pancreas or metastatic disease. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:With a median follow-up of 48.9 months, progression was identified in 124 patients (27.6%); 108(24.1%) with non-invasive and 16(3.6%) with invasive progression. Median progression follow-up was longer for invasive progression (85.4 vs. 55.9 months; P = 0.001). Five- and 10-year estimates for a cumulative incidence of invasive progression were 6.4% and 12.9% versus 26.9% and 41.5% for non-invasive progression. After risk-adjustment, multifocality (HR 4.53, 95%CI 1.34-15.26; P = 0.02) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in the original resection (HR 3.60, 95%CI 1.13-11.48; P = 0.03) were associated with invasive progression. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Progression to invasive carcinoma can occur years after the surgical resection of a non-invasive IPMN. HGD in the original resection is a risk factor for invasive progression but some cases of low-grade dysplasia also progressed to cancer. Patients with high-risk features such as HGD and multifocal cysts should be considered for more intensive surveillance and represent an important cohort for future trials such as anti-inflammatory or prophylactic immunotherapy.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To investigate the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy on surgical complications in patients after pancreatic resection for (borderline-)resectable pancreatic cancer. Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Preoperative chemoradiotherapy is increasingly used in patients with (borderline-)resectable pancreatic cancer. Concerns have been raised about the potential harmful effect of any preoperative therapy on the surgical complication rate after pancreatic resection. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:An observational analysis was performed within the multicenter randomized controlled PREOPANC trial (April 2013-July 2017). The trial randomly assigned (1:1) patients to preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery and the remaining adjuvant chemotherapy or to immediate surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The main analysis consisted of a per-protocol approach. The endpoints of the present analyses were the rate of postoperative complications. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:This study included 246 patients from 16 centers, of whom 66 patients underwent resection after preoperative therapy and 98 patients after immediate surgery. No differences were found regarding major complications (37.9% vs 30.6%, P = 0.400), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (9.1% vs 5.1%, P = 0.352), delayed gastric emptying (21.2% vs 22.4%, P = 0.930), bile leakage (4.5% vs 3.1%, P = 0.686), intra-abdominal infections (12.1% vs 10.2%, P = 0.800), and mortality (3.0% vs 4.1%, P = 1.000). There was a significant lower incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (0% vs 9.2%, P = 0.011). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Preoperative chemoradiotherapy did not increase the incidence of surgical complications or mortality and reduced the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula after resection in patients with (borderline-)resectable pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To evaluate the significance of UDD in IPMNs. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The uncinate process of the pancreas has an independent ductal drainage system. International consensus guidelines of IPMNs still consider it as a branch-duct, even though it is the main drainage system for the uncinate process. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A retrospective review of all surgically treated IPMNs at our institution after 2008 was performed. Preoperative radiological studies were reviewed by an abdominal radiologist who was blinded to the pathological results. In addition to the Fukuoka criteria, presence of UDD was recorded. Using multivariate analysis, the pathological significance of UDD in predicting advanced neoplasia [high grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma (HGD/IC)] was determined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Two hundred sixty patients were identified (mean age at diagnosis was 68 years and 49% were females): 122 (47%) had HGD/IC. UDD was noted in 59 (23%), of which 36 (61%) had HGD/IC (P &lt; 0.003). On multivariate analysis, UDD was an independent predictor of HGD/IC (odds ratio = 2.99, P &lt; 0.04). Subgroup analysis on patients with IPMNs confined to the dorsal portion of the gland (n = 161), also demonstrated UDD to be a significant predictor of HGD/IC in those remote lesions (odds ratio: 4.41, P = 0.039). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This is the largest study to evaluate the significance of UDD in IPMNs and shows it to be a high-risk feature. This association persisted for remote IPMNs limited to the dorsal pancreas, suggesting UDD may be associated with an aggressive phenotype even in remote IPMN lesions.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, which limits surgical options and portends a dismal prognosis. Current oncologic PDAC therapies confer marginal benefit and, thus, a significant unmet clinical need exists for new therapeutic strategies. To identify effective PDAC therapies, we leveraged a syngeneic orthotopic PDAC transplant mouse model to perform a large-scale, in vivo screen of 16 single-agent and 41 two-drug targeted therapy combinations in mice. Among 57 drug conditions screened, combined inhibition of heat shock protein (Hsp)-90 and MEK was found to produce robust suppression of tumor growth, leading to an 80% increase in the survival of PDAC-bearing mice with no significant toxicity. Mechanistically, we observed that single-agent MEK inhibition led to compensatory activation of resistance pathways, including components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, which was overcome with the addition of HSP90 inhibition. The combination of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) was also active in vitro in established human PDAC cell lines and in vivo in patient-derived organoid PDAC transplant models. These findings encourage the clinical development of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) combination therapy and highlight the power of clinically relevant in vivo model systems for identifying cancer therapies.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatoblastoma is a rare pediatric malignant neoplasm characterized by its histological resemblance to fetal pancreatic tissue and poor clinical outcomes. Preoperative diagnosis of the neoplasm is difficult due to its rarity, variable clinical presentation, and its lack of distinct laboratory markers. Current mainstay of treatment is surgical resection of the tumor, although a standard of care has not yet been established. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Data were collected on one patient admitted to the University of Virginia Hospital System. Radiology, hematopoietic cell transplant, and biopsy data were collected according to the best clinical practice. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Herein, we describe the case of an adult patient with pancreatoblastoma treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic cell transplantation.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma are aggressive tumours where preoperative assessment is challenging. Disseminated tumour cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM) are associated with impaired prognosis in a variety of epithelial cancers. In a cohort of patients with presumed resectable pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma, we evaluated the frequency and the potential prognostic impact of the preoperative presence of DTC, defined as cytokeratin-positive cells detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Preoperative BM samples from 242 patients selected for surgical resection of presumed resectable pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma from 09/2009 to 12/2014, were analysed for presence of CK-positive cells by ICC. The median observation time was 21.5 months. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Successful resections of malignant tumours were performed in 179 of the cases, 30 patients resected had benign pancreatic disease based on postoperative histology, and 33 were deemed inoperable intraoperatively due to advanced disease. Overall survival for patients with resected carcinoma was 21.1 months (95% CI: 18.0-24.1), for those with benign disease OS was 101 months (95% CI: 69.4-132) and for those with advanced disease OS was 8.8 months (95% CI: 4.3-13.3). The proportion of patients with detected CK-positive cells was 6/168 (3.6%) in resected malignant cases, 2/31 (6.5%) in advanced disease and 4/29 (13.8%) in benign disease. The presence of CK-positive cells was not correlated to OS or DFS, neither in the entire cohort nor in the subgroup negative for circulating tumour cells (CTC).

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To explore the diagnostic value of pancreatic perfusion CT combined with contrast-enhanced CT in one-time scanning (PCECT) in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) and to evaluate the difference of perfusion parameters between different grades of PNETs. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:From October 2016 to December 2018, forty consecutive patients with histopathological-proven PNETs were identified retrospectively that received PCECT for the preoperative PNETs evaluation. Two board certified radiologists who were blinded to the clinical data evaluated the images independently. The image characters of PNETs vs. tumor-free pancreatic parenchymal and different grades of PNETs were analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:One-time PCECT scanning had a detection rate of 89.1% for PNETs, which was higher than the detection accuracy of the perfusion CT only (83.6%). The perfusion parameters of PNETs including blood volume (BV), blood flow (BF), mean slope of increase (MSI), and capillary surface permeability (PS) were significantly increased than those of tumor-free pancreatic parenchyma (p &lt; 0.05, respectively). For differential comparison between grade I (G1) and grade II (G2) tumors, the parameters of BF and impulse residue function (IRF) of tumor tissue were significantly higher in the G2 tumors (p &lt; 0.05, for both). In this study, the total radiation dose of the whole PCECT scan was 16.241 ± 2.289 mSv. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The one-time PCECT scan may improve the detection of PNETs according to morphological features and perfusion parameters with a relative small radiation dose. The perfusion parameters of BF and IRF may be used to help distinguish G1 and G2 tumors in the preoperative evaluation.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Paratesticular tumors (PTT) are rare and form a heterogenous group, ranging from benign to malignant high grade sarcomas. This study was undertaken to describe the clinicopathological spectrum of PTTs received over a 20-year period. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:All primary and secondary PTTs diagnosed from 2000 to 2019 in the pathology department of a tertiary care hospital in North India were retrospectively reviewed. Gross, histopathological features and immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings were correlated with clinical details. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 169 intra-scrotal tumors were diagnosed during the study period, out of which there were 30 PTTs (in 27 patients) comprising 17.75%. Age range was 4 to 85 years (median 58 years). Benign PTTs were the commonest (n = 21, 70%), followed by metastasis to the paratesticular region (n = 6, 20%) and then primary malignant PTTs (n = 3, 10%). The commonest benign PTT was lipoma (n = 16, 76.19%), followed by adenomatoid tumor (n = 3, 14.28%) with one case each (4.76%) of cellular angiofibroma and hemangioma. Among primary malignant PTT, there were two cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, and one case of biphasic malignant mesothelioma. Metastatic tumors included four cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, and one case each of pancreatic signet ring cell carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PTTs show a wide clinicopathological spectrum. Benign PTTs are commoner than malignant PTTs. Meticulous grossing and histopathological examination supplemented by IHC is essential for an accurate diagnosis of this heterogenous class of tumors, which influences the role of adjuvant therapy and patient prognosis.</p>

<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habit. This condition is one of the most frequent reasons to seek a gastroenterology consultation in primary and secondary care. The diagnosis of IBS is made by identifying characteristic symptoms, as defined by the Rome criteria, and excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases that might otherwise explain these symptoms. Organic conditions that can be mistaken for IBS include coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and, in those with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms, chronic gastrointestinal infections, microscopic colitis, and primary bile acid diarrhoea. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth being associated with IBS is shrouded with controversy and uncertainty, mainly because of invalid tests due to poor sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions. There is insufficient evidence to link IBS-type symptoms with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, since both are hampered by conflicting data. Finally, there is growing appreciation that IBS can present in patients with known but stable organic gastrointestinal diseases, such as quiescent IBD or coeliac disease. Recognising functional gut symptoms in these individuals is paramount so that potentially harmful escalations in immunosuppressive therapy can be avoided and attention can be focused on addressing disorders of gut-brain interaction. This Review endeavours to aid clinicians who practise adult gastroenterology in recognising the potential overlap between IBS and organic gastrointestinal diseases and highlights areas in need of further research and clarity.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The worldwide prevalence and incidence of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) have been increasing recently, although few studies have analyzed data on the current situation of NENs in Japan. Here, the Japan Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (JNETS) planned to investigate the recent incidence and distribution of these tumors using data from the national cancer registry started in 2016. This study examined the incidence and distribution of primary sites as well as rate of advanced disease from this population-based registry. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A retrospective, population-based study using data from the national cancer registry in Japan (NCR) was conducted to evaluate patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic NEN (GEP-NEN) in 2016. Associated population data were used to determine annual age-adjusted incidences. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 6735 individuals were diagnosed with GEP-NEN in Japan in 2016. Annual onset incidence was 0.70/100,000 for pancreatic NEN and 2.84/100,000 for gastrointestinal NEN. NEN in the ileum accounted for only 1% of total GEP-NENs in Japan. Most NENs in the esophagus or lungs were neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), while the majority of those in the duodenum, ileum, appendix and rectum were grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Median age at initial diagnosis was in between 60 to 65. Tumors in the duodenum, appendix and rectum were mostly limited to local, while those in the esophagus, stomach and colon tended to show distant metastasis. In Japan, initial treatment for GEP-NENs was resection even if the tumor was NEC. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This is the first report of a national registry-based incidence and distribution of GEP-NEN in Japan. These data will serve as an important first step to determining the exact etiology and trends for this pathology in Japan.</p>

<p>Drug-induced pancreatitis is often mild to moderate in severity, but severe and even fatal cases can occur. Here, we report a 74-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for recurrent renal cell carcinoma, who presented with abdominal pain after administration of pazopanib following nivolumab and was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis. Administration of methylprednisolone and conservative treatment were initiated, but clinical findings and laboratory tests rapidly worsened. When she died, an autopsy was performed. The autopsy findings suggested the possibility of pancreatitis as immune-related adverse events. To the best of our knowledge, no fatal cases of acute pancreatitis due to nivolumab or pazopanib have been reported. We considered that the effects of nivolumab were sustained in the pancreas, and pazopanib administration might have worsened the toxicity.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To reappraise the optimal number of examined lymph nodes (ELN) in pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The well-established threshold of 15 ELN in PD for PDAC is optimized for detecting one positive node (PLN) per the previous 7 edition of the AJCC staging manual. In the framework of the 8 edition, where at least four PLN are needed for an N2 diagnosis, this threshold may be inadequate for accurate staging. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients who underwent upfront PD at two academic institutions between 2000 and 2016 were analyzed. The optimal ELN threshold was defined as the cut-point associated with a 95% probability of identifying at least 4 PLN in N2 patients. The results were validated addressing the N-status distribution and stage migration. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, 1218 patients were included. The median number of ELN was 26 (IQR 17-37). ELN was independently associated with N2-status (OR 1.27, p &lt; 0.001). The estimated optimal threshold of ELN was 28. This cut-point enabled improved detection of N2 patients and stage III disease (58% versus 37%, p = 0.001). The median survival was 28.6 months. There was an improved survival in N0/N1 patients when ELN exceeded 28, suggesting a stage migration effect (47 versus 29 months, adjusted HR 0.649, p &lt; 0.001). In N2 patients, this threshold was not associated with survival on multivariable analysis. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Examining at least 28 LN in PD for PDAC ensures optimal staging through improved detection of N2/stage III disease. This may have relevant implications for benchmarking processes and quality implementation.</p>

<p>Assessment of the Ki67 index is critical for grading well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs), which can show a broad range of labeling that defines the WHO grade (G1-G3). Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD-NECs) have a relatively high Ki67 index, &gt;20% in all cases and commonly exceeding 50%. After anecdotally observing PD-NECs with an unexpectedly low and heterogeneous Ki67 index following chemotherapy in 5 cases, we identified 15 additional cases of treated high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (HG-NENs). The study cohort comprised 20 cases; 11 PD-NECs, 8 mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 WD-NET, G3 from various anatomic sites (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and breast). The Ki67 index was evaluated on pretreatment (when available) and posttreatment samples. Topographic heterogeneity in the Ki67 index was expressed using a semi-quantitative score of 0 (no heterogeneity) to 5 (&gt;80% difference between maximal Ki67 and minimal Ki67 indices). Relative to the pretreatment group (n=9, mean Ki67 of 86.3%, range 80% to 100%), the neoplasms in the posttreatment group (n=20, mean Ki67 of 47.7%, range 1% to 90%) showed a significantly lower Ki67 index (18/20 cases). Of the 18 cases with a relatively low Ki67 index, 15 showed heterogeneous labeling (mean heterogeneity score of 2.3, range 1 to 5) and in 3 cases it was a homogeneously low. This phenomenon was observed in all subtypes of HG-NENs. In 6 cases, the alterations in Ki67 index following treatment were sufficient to place these HG-NENs in the WHO G1 or G2 grade, erroneously suggesting a diagnosis of WD-NET, and in 9 cases there was sufficient heterogeneity in the Ki67 index to suggest that a limited biopsy may sample an area of low Ki67, even though hotspot regions with a Ki67 index of &gt;20% persisted. In 7 cases, the alterations in the Ki67 index were accompanied by morphologic features resembling a WD-NET. These observations suggest that there is a potential for misinterpretation of previously treated PD-NECs as WD-NETs, or for assigning a lower grade in G3 WD-NETs.

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The intestinal microbiome affects the prevalence and pathophysiology of a variety of diseases ranging from inflammation to cancer. A reduced taxonomic or functional diversity of the microbiome was often observed in association with poorer health outcomes or disease in general. Conversely, factors or manifest diseases that determine the long-term stability or instability of the microbiome are largely unknown. We aimed to identify disease-relevant phenotypes associated with faecal microbiota (in-)stability. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 2564 paired faecal samples from 1282 participants of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were collected at a 5-year (median) interval and microbiota profiles determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The changes in faecal microbiota over time were associated with highly standardised and comprehensive phenotypic data to determine factors related to microbiota (in-)stability. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The overall microbiome landscape remained remarkably stable over time. The greatest microbiome instability was associated with factors contributing to metabolic syndrome such as fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus. These, in turn, were associated with an increase in facultative pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae or Escherichia/Shigella. Greatest stability of the microbiome was determined by higher initial alpha diversity, female sex, high household income and preserved exocrine pancreatic function. Participants who newly developed fatty liver disease or diabetes during the 5-year follow-up already displayed significant microbiota changes at study entry when the diseases were absent. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study identifies distinct components of metabolic liver disease to be associated with instability of the intestinal microbiome, increased abundance of facultative pathogens and thus greater susceptibility toward dysbiosis-associated diseases.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Disconnectedpancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS), a severe complication of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP), may require surgery, usually by distal splenopancreatectomy, thus increasing the risk of diabetes. We describe a new technique reconnecting the distal pancreas to the digestive tract. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This technique was proposed after failure of non-surgical treatment and at least 3 months after the onset of ANP in non-diabetic or non-insulin dependent diabetic patients with a distal pancreas of at least 5 cm. The ruptured zone was identified and the distal side was anastomosed to the stomach or the jejunum. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:From 2013 to June 2019, 36 patients (median age = 49 years) with DPDS underwent a “French reconnection” procedure, indicated for chronic pain/recurrent pancreatitis (n = 35; 97%), persistent pancreatic fistula (n = 33; 91%), or digestive compression/fistulisation (n = 9; 25%). Median preoperative weight loss was 10 kg (4-27), the median number of hospitalisations per patient was 5(1-8) and 24(67%) patients had received endoscopic/percutaneous treatment. Surgery was performed in median 279(90-2000) days after ANP, laparoscopically in 9(25%) patients. The remnant pancreas (median length = 70 mm; range = 50-130) was anastomosed to the stomach (n = 30) or the jejunum (n = 6). There were 13(36%) postoperative grade B/C pancreatic fistulas and 3(10%) bleedings including one death (mortality = 3%). The median hospital stay was 18 (7-121) days. After a median follow-up of 24 (4-53) months, all pancreatic fistulas had healed and the clinical success rate was 91%. Median BMI increased from 22 to 25 kg/m2. In patients with normal pancreatic function, postoperative de novo endocrine and severe exocrine insufficiencies were observed in 4/27 (15%) and 7/22 (32%), respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The “French reconnection” procedure, as an alternative to distal splenopancreatectomy for the treatment of DPDS, provides good control of symptoms and decreases the risk of pancreatic insufficiency.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To explore the clinicopathologic features and differential diagnosis of breast primary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (MCA). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Pathological characteristics and immunophenotype of one case of MCA were analyzed. Literature was reviewed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Grossly, the area of the tumor cut surface was gelationous. Microscopcally, the tumor was composed of variably sized cystic spaces lined by mucus-rich tumor cells with single columnar, stratified appearance and papillary formation. The degree of cytologic atypia varied from region to region. The tumor cells were positive for CK7, GATA3, negative for CK20, ER, PR and HER2. Most peripheral myoepithelial cells were negative for P63 and SMMHC. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:MCA is a rare primary breast cancer and strikingly similar to ovarian, pancreatic and gastrointestinal counterparts. The diagnosis cannot be made until the metastatic lesion is ruled out. On the other hand, the biologic behavior of MCA is reportedly favorable despite a high proliferation index and triple negative biomarker status. Therefore, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation is questionable.</p>

<p>Apical microvilli of polarized epithelial cells govern the absorption of metabolites and the transport of fluid in tissues. Previously, we reported that tall and dense basal microvilli present on the endothelial cells of pancreatic cancers, a lethal malignancy with a high metabolism and unusual hypomicrovascularity, contain nutrient trafficking vesicles and glucose; their length and density were related to the glucose uptake of pancreatic cancers in a small-scale analysis. However, the implications of basal microvilli on pancreatic cancers are unknown. Here, we evaluated the clinical implications of basal microvilli in 106 pancreatic cancers. We found that basal microvilli are a dominant change in pancreatic cancers. The presence of longer and denser basal microvilli on the microvessels in pancreatic cancer tissues positively correlated with increased glucose uptake and higher metastatic (or invasive) and proliferative potentials of neoplastic cells and vice versa. Clinically, postoperative patients with longer and denser basal microvilli were more prone to unfavorable pathological characteristics and dismal prognoses. They were even more refractory to adjuvant therapy than those with shorter and thinner basal microvilli were. Our findings show that basal microvilli define the metabolic capacity and lethal phenotype of pancreatic cancers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pain in chronic pancreatitis is subdivided in a continuous or intermittent pattern, each thought to represent a different entity, requiring specific treatment. Because evidence is missing, we studied pain patterns in a prospective longitudinal nationwide study. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:1131 patients with chronic pancreatitis (fulfilling M-ANNHEIM criteria) were included between 2011 and 2018 in 30 Dutch hospitals. Patients with continuous or intermittent pain were compared for demographics, pain characteristics, quality of life (Short-Form 36), imaging findings, disease duration and treatment. Alternation of pain pattern and associated variables were longitudinally assessed using a multivariable multinomial logistic regression model. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:At inclusion, 589 patients (52%) had continuous pain, 231 patients (20%) had intermittent pain and 311 patients (28%) had no pain. Patients with continuous pain had more severe pain, used more opioids and neuropathic pain medication, and had a lower quality of life. There were no differences between pain patterns for morphological findings on imaging, disease duration and treatment. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 552 of 905 patients (61%) alternated at least once between pain patterns. All alternations were associated with the Visual Analogue Scale pain intensity score and surgery was only associated with the change from pain to no pain. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Continuous and intermittent pain patterns in chronic pancreatitis do not seem to be the result of distinctly different pathophysiological entities. The subjectively reported character of pain is not related to imaging findings or disease duration. Pain patterns often change over time and are merely a feature of how severity of pain is experienced.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to assess the impact of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) on patient disease-specific survival and recurrence after curative distal pancreatectomy (DP) for pancreatic cancer. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This was a retrospective case-control analysis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We examined the data of adult patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) of the body and tail of the pancreas undergoing curative DP, over a 10-year period in 12 European surgical departments, from a prospectively implemented database. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among the 382 included patients, 283 met the strict inclusion criteria; 139 were males (49.1%) and the median age of the entire population was 70 years (range 37-88). A total of 121 POPFs were observed (42.8%), 42 (14.9%) of which were CR-POPFs. The median follow-up period was 24 months (range 3-120). Although poorer in the POPF group, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) did not differ significantly between patients with and without CR-POPF (p = 0.224 and p = 0.165, respectively). CR-POPF was not significantly associated with local or peritoneal recurrence (p = 0.559 and p = 0.302, respectively). A smaller percentage of patients benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy after POPF (76.2% vs. 83.8%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.228). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:CR-POPF is a major complication after DP but it did not affect the postoperative therapeutic path or long-term oncologic outcomes.

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION”:The impact of glycemic status and insulin resistance on the risk of pancreatic cancer in the nondiabetic population remains uncertain. We aimed to examine the association of glycemic status and insulin resistance with pancreatic cancer mortality in individuals with and without diabetes. Label=“METHODS”:This is a cohort study of 572,021 Korean adults without cancer at baseline, who participated in repeat screening examinations which included fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin, and were followed for a median of 8.4 years (interquartile range, 5.3 -13.2 years). Vital status and pancreatic cancer mortality were ascertained through linkage to national death records. Label=“RESULTS”:During 5,211,294 person-years of follow-up, 260 deaths from pancreatic cancer were identified, with a mortality rate of 5.0 per 10 person-years. In the overall population, the risk of pancreatic cancer mortality increased with increasing levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c in a dose-response manner, and this association was observed even in individuals without diabetes. In nondiabetic individuals without previously diagnosed or screen-detected diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were positively associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality. Specifically, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for pancreatic cancer mortality comparing the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.49 (1.08-2.05), and the corresponding hazard ratio comparing the insulin ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.43 (1.05-1.95). These associations remained significant when introducing changes in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and other confounders during follow-up as time-varying covariates. Label=“DISCUSSION”:Glycemic status, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, even in individuals without diabetes, were independently associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Our objective was to examine the associations between early discharge and readmission after major abdominal operations. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Advances in patient care resulted in earlier patient discharge after complex abdominal operations. Whether early discharge is associated with patient readmissions remains controversial.

Patient readmission was stratified by 6 operative groups. Patients who were discharged prior to median discharge date within each operative group were categorized as an early discharge. Analyses tested associations between early discharge and likelihood of 30-day postoperative unplanned readmission. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:364,609 patients with major abdominal operations were included. Individual patient groups and corresponding median day of discharge were: laparoscopic colectomy (n = 152,575; median = 4), open colectomy (n = 137,462; median = 7), laparoscopic proctectomy (n = 12,238; median = 5), open proctectomy (n = 24,925; median = 6), major hepatectomy (n = 9,805; median = 6), pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 27,604; median = 8). Early discharge was not associated with an increase in proportion of readmissions in any operative group. Early discharge was associated with a decrease in average proportion of patient readmissions compared to patients discharged on median date in each of the operative groups: laparoscopic colectomy 6% versus 8%, open colectomy 11% versus 14%, laparoscopic proctectomy 13% versus 16%, open proctectomy 13% vs 17%, major hepatectomy 8% versus 12%, pancreatoduodenectomy 16% versus 20% (all p ≤ 0.02).

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Cardiometabolic abnormalities are a leading cause of death among women, including women with cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This study examined the association between prediagnosis cardiovascular health and total and cause-specific mortality among 12,076 postmenopausal women who developed local- or regional-stage invasive cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). Cardiovascular risk factors included waist circumference, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related cancers included breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for important predictors of survival. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:After a median follow-up of 10.0 years from the date of the cancer diagnosis, there were 3607 total deaths, with 1546 (43%) due to cancer. Most participants (62.9%) had 1 or 2 cardiometabolic risk factors, and 8.1% had 3 or 4. In adjusted models, women with 3 to 4 risk factors (vs none) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.73-2.30), death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.88-5.57), cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.1-1.72), and other-cause mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.70-2.69). A higher waist circumference was associated with greater all-cause mortality (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among postmenopausal women diagnosed with cancer in the WHI, cardiometabolic risk factors before the cancer diagnosis were associated with greater all-cause, CVD, cancer-specific, and other-cause mortality. These results raise hypotheses regarding potential clinical intervention strategies targeting cardiometabolic abnormalities that require future prospective studies for confirmation. Label=“LAY SUMMARY” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:This study uses information from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) to find out whether cardiac risk factors are related to a greater risk of dying among older women with cancer. The WHI is the largest study of medical problems faced by older women in this country. The results show that women who have 3 or 4 risk factors are more likely to die of any cause, heart disease, or cancer in comparison with women with no risk factors. It is concluded that interventions to help to lower the burden of cardiac risk factors can have an important impact on survivorship among women with cancer.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Endoscopic necrosectomy has emerged as the preferred treatment modality for walled-off pancreatic necrosis. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct endoscopic necrosectomy with and without hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) lavage. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Retrospective chart reviews were performed for all patients undergoing endoscopic transmural management of walled-off pancreatic necrosis at 9 major medical centers from November 2011 to August 2018. Clinical success was defined as the resolution of the collection by imaging within 6 months, without requiring non-endoscopic procedures or surgery. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 293 patients, 204 met the inclusion criteria. Technical and clinical success rates were 100% (204/204) and 81% (166/189), respectively. For patients, 122 (59.8%) patients had at least one H2O2 necrosectomy (H2O2 group) and 82 (40.2%) patients had standard endoscopic necrosectomy. Clinical success was higher in the H2O2 group: 106/113 (93.8%) vs 60/76 (78.9%), P = 0.002. On a multivariate analysis, the use of H2O2 was associated with higher clinical success rate (odds ratio 3.30, P = 0.033) and earlier resolution (odds ratio 2.27, P &lt; 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 274 days, 27 complications occurred. Comparing procedures performed with and without H2O2 (n = 250 vs 183), there was no difference in post-procedure bleeding (7 vs 9, P = 0.25), perforation (2 vs 3, P = 0.66), infection (1 vs 2, P = 0.58), or overall complication rate (n = 13 [5.2%] vs 14 [7.7%], P = 0.30). Label=“DISCUSSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:H2O2-assisted endoscopic necrosectomy had a higher clinical success rate and a shorter time to resolution with equivalent complication rates relative to standard necrosectomy.See the visual abstract at <a href="http://links.lww.com/AJG/B714" class="uri">http://links.lww.com/AJG/B714</a>.</p>

Based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, 62.5% and 50% had stable disease after one and two PIPAC procedures, respectively. 8 patients underwent 2 PIPAC procedures, with improvement of median PCI and Peritoneal Regression Grade Score from 15 to 12 and 2.5 to 2.0, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The recommended phase 2 dose is 120 mg/m2. Future studies should further delineate the efficacy and role of PIPAC oxaliplatin for peritoneal metastases.</p>

<p>Label=“AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Breast neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) constitute a rare histologic subtype of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and their definition according to the WHO classification was revised in 2019. Breast NETs display histologic and transcriptomic similarities with mucinous breast carcinomas (MuBCs). Here, we sought to compare the repertoire of genetic alterations in breast NETs with MuBCs and NETs from other anatomic origins. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:On histologic review applying the new WHO criteria, 18 breast tumours with neuroendocrine differentiation were reclassified as breast NETs (n=10) or other breast cancers with neuroendocrine differentiation (n=8). We reanalysed targeted sequencing or whole-exome sequencing data of breast NETs (n=10), MuBCs type A (n=12) and type B (n=11). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Breast NETs and MuBCs were found to be genetically similar, harbouring a lower frequency of PIK3CA mutations, 1q gains and 16q losses than ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. 3/10 breast NETs harboured the hallmark features of ER-positive disease (ie, PIK3CA mutations and concurrent 1q gains/16q losses). Breast NETs showed an enrichment of oncogenic/likely oncogenic mutations affecting transcription factors compared with common forms of ER-positive breast cancer and with pancreatic and pulmonary NETs. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Breast NETs are heterogeneous and are characterised by an enrichment of mutations in transcription factors and likely constitute a spectrum of entities histologically and genomically related to MuBCs. While most breast NETs are distinct from ER-positive/HER2-negative IDC-NSTs, a subset of breast NETs appears to be genetically similar to common forms of ER-positive breast cancer, suggesting that some breast cancers may acquire neuroendocrine differentiation later in tumour evolution.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with high mortality. Acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member E (ANP32E), a specific H2A.Z chaperone, has been shown to contribute to breast cancer development. However, the significance of ANP32E in pancreatic cancer is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of ANP32E in pancreatic cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The expression of ANP32E in 179 pancreatic cancer tissues and 171 normal tissues, and the correlation between ANP32E expression and patients’ survival were analyzed from the TCGA database. ANP32E was over-expressed and silenced using lentivirus. siRNA was used to knock down β-catenin. CCK8, colony formation, cell cycle and transwell experiments were performed to determine cell proliferation and migration. qRT-PCR and Western blot were conducted to detect mRNA and protein expression. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:ANP32E was up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Up-regulation of ANP32E predicted poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of ANP32E suppressed the proliferation, colony growth and migration of PANC1 and MIA cells. By contrast, ANP32E over-expression promoted the proliferation and migration of both cells. In addition, ANP32E accelerated the cell cycle progression in PANC1 and MIA cells. Molecular experiments showed that ANP32E activated β-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling. Silencing of β-catenin reduced cell proliferation and migration in ANP32E over-expressed cells. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our results propose that ANP32E functions as an oncogene in pancreatic cancer via activating β-catenin.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Higher socioeconomic status (SES) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) race/ethnicity are associated with higher treatment rates and longer overall survival (OS) among US patients with stage I-II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The proportion of OS disparities mediated through treatment disparities (PM) and the proportion predicted to be eliminated (PE) if treatment disparities were eliminated are unknown. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed 2007-2015 data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) census tract-level database and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) using causal mediation analysis methods to understand the extent to which treatment disparities mediate OS disparities. In the first set of decompositions, race/ethnicity was controlled for as a covariate proximal to SES, and lower SES strata were compared with the highest SES stratum. In the second set, an intersectional perspective was taken and each SES-race/ethnicity combination was compared with highest SES-NHW patients, who had the highest treatment rates and longest OS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The SEER and NCDB cohorts contained 16,921 patients and 44,638 patients, respectively. When race/ethnicity was controlled for, PMs ranged from 43 to 48% and PEs ranged from 46 to 50% for various lower SES strata. When separately comparing each SES-race/ethnicity combination with the highest SES-NHW patients, results were similar for lower SES-NHW patients but differed markedly for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients, for whom PMs ranged from 60 to 80% and PEs ranged from 55 to 75% for most lower SES strata. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:These results suggest that efforts to reduce treatment disparities are worthwhile, particularly for NHB and Hispanic patients, and simultaneously point to the importance of non-treatment-related causal pathways.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors have a nutrient-poor, desmoplastic, and highly innervated tumor microenvironment. Although neurons can release stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic contribution of peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal innervation using LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor growth. Our data indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical adaptation to support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study aims to define the role of surgery and assess different therapies for nonagenarians with localized, nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients ≥ 90 years of age with nonmetastatic, localized PDAC from 2004-2016. Postoperative mortality was assessed at 30 and 90 days in patients receiving pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy. Overall survival (OS) was compared between three treatment groups: surgery alone, chemotherapy alone, and chemoradiation (chemoRT) alone. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 380,524 patients with PDAC, 98 patients ≥ 90 years of age underwent curative-intent resection; 55% were female and 75% had a Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0. A total of 17% received postoperative chemotherapy, 51.1% had poorly differentiated tumors with a median tumor size of 3 cm, 55.1% had positive lymph nodes, and 19.4% had positive resection margins. Postoperative median length of stay was 11 days. Postoperative 30- and 90-day mortality was 10.0% and 18.9%, respectively. Median OS for the surgery alone group was 11.6 months compared with 20.4 months in those receiving adjuvant therapy (p = 0.01). Among nonoperative PDAC patients, median OS in patients receiving chemotherapy only (n = 207) was 7.2 months, while chemoRT only (n = 100) was similar to surgery only (11 versus 11.6 months, p = 0.97). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Even in well-selected nonagenarians, pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy carries a high mortality rate. While adjuvant therapy after resection provides the best survival, it is seldom achieved, and chemoRT alone affords identical survival statistics as surgery alone. These data suggest it is reasonable to consider chemoRT as initial therapy, then reassess candidacy for resection if performance status allows.</p>

<p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) controls metabolic organ homeostasis and eating/drinking behavior via FGF receptor 1/Klothoβ (FGFR1/KLB) complexes expressed in adipocytes, pancreatic acinar cells, and the nervous system in mice. Chronic administration of recombinant FGF21 or engineered variants improves metabolic health in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans; however, the rapid turnover of these molecules limits therapeutic utility. Here we show that the bispecific anti-FGFR1/KLB agonist antibody BFKB8488A induced marked weight loss in obese cynomolgus monkeys while elevating serum adiponectin and the adipose expression of FGFR1 target genes, demonstrating its action as an FGF21 mimetic. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study in overweight/obese human participants, subcutaneous BFKB8488A injection caused transient body weight reduction, sustained improvement in cardiometabolic parameters, and a trend toward reduction in preference for sweet taste and carbohydrate intake. These data suggest that specific activation of the FGFR1/KLB complex in humans can be used as therapy for obesity-related metabolic defects.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of subsequent primary neoplasms (SPNs), but the risk of developing specific digestive SPNs beyond age 40 years remains uncertain. We investigated risks of specific digestive SPNs within the largest available cohort worldwide. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The PanCareSurFup cohort includes 69 460 five-year survivors of childhood cancer from 12 countries in Europe. Risks of digestive SPNs were quantified using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks and cumulative incidence. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:427 digestive SPNs (214 colorectal, 62 liver, 48 stomach, 44 pancreas, 59 other) were diagnosed in 413 survivors. Wilms tumour (WT) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors were at greatest risk (SIR 12.1; 95% CI 9.6 to 15.1; SIR 7.3; 95% CI 5.9 to 9.0, respectively). The cumulative incidence increased the most steeply with increasing age for WT survivors, reaching 7.4% by age 55% and 9.6% by age 60 years (1.0% expected based on general population rates). Regarding colorectal SPNs, WT and HL survivors were at greatest risk; both seven times that expected. By age 55 years, 2.3% of both WT (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9) and HL (95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) survivors had developed a colorectal SPN-comparable to the risk among members of the general population with at least two first-degree relatives affected. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Colonoscopy surveillance before age 55 is recommended in many European countries for individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer, but not for WT and HL survivors despite a comparable risk profile. Clinically, serious consideration should be given to the implementation of colonoscopy surveillance while further evaluation of its benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness in WT and HL survivors is undertaken.</p>

All patients underwent USWE assessment at the pancreatic neck level. Intraoperative variables including pancreatic texture, pancreatic duct diameter, blood loss and histological grading of fibrosis were also recorded. Associations between USWE and intraoperative variables and histological grading with the development of POPF were analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 62 patients assessed, 50 patients (mean age: 53 ± 14 years; 31 males) were included. POPF and clinically relevant POPF (CRPOPF) were observed in 22 (44%) and 7 (14%) patients respectively. Soft pancreas was an independent predictor of CRPOPF (p = 0.04). The mean USWE valve was significantly lower in patients with CRPOPF as compared to no CRPOPF (9.7 Kpa vs. 12.8Kpa, p = 0.016). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, USWE value of 12.65Kpa yielded sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 47%, respectively, for prediction of CRPOPF. USWE showed significant correlation with intraoperative pancreatic texture (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) = 0.565, p = 0.001).

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although 10% formalin is a standard preservative in pancreatic FNAs, the effect of CytoLyt on pancreatic tissue preservation has not been systematically explored. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Smears and cell blocks from CytoLyt-fixed (CF-CBs) and formalin-fixed (FF-CBs) pancreatic FNAs were blindly reviewed without knowledge of the fixative used, and the presence of tissue/tumor autolysis was noted. Controls included FF-CBs from pancreatic FNAs, CF-CBs from nonpancreatic FNAs, and 4 pancreatic FNAs with matched CF-CBs and FF-CBs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found that 62 of 85 (73%) pancreatic FNAs with CF-CBs showed significant autolysis, which was most pronounced in acinar cells and/or tumor cells with benign acinar cells in the background, compared with 2 of 46 (4%) FF-CBs (P &lt; .0001) and 3 of 26 (12%) CF-CBs from nonpancreatic FNAs (73% vs 12%; P &lt; .0001). Of the 4 pancreatic FNAs with matched CF-CBs and FF-CBs, all 4 CF-CBs showed marked autolysis versus none of the matched FF-CBs. Of the 23 (27%) pancreatic FNAs with CF-CBs that did not show autolysis, 10 had no acinar cells, and 7 had only minute tissue fragments on CB. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:While CytoLyt is a useful fixative for nonpancreatic FNAs it is a suboptimal fixative for pancreatic FNAs and is associated with tissue/tumor autolysis in the majority of cases, influencing morphologic evaluation, and potentially immunocytochemical staining. Autolysis appears to be due to acinar enzymes whose effect is likely interrupted/inhibited by formalin fixation. Cytopathologists and cytotechnologists should be mindful of this pitfall and should avoid using CytoLyt as a fixative for pancreatic FNAs.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Disparities in pancreatic cancer outcomes between black and white patients are well documented. This study aimed to use a more novel index to examine the impact of racial segregation on the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of pancreatic cancer in black patients compared with white patients. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Black and white adults with pancreatic cancer in urban counties were identified using data from the 2018 submission of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program and the 2010 Census. The racial index of dissimilarity (IoD), a validated proxy of racial segregation, was used to assess the evenness with which whites and blacks are distributed across census tracts in each county. Multivariate Poisson regression was performed, and stepwise models were constructed for each of the outcomes. Overall survival was studied using the Kaplan-Meier method. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The study enrolled 60,172 adults with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer between 2005 and 2015. Overall, the black patients (13.8% of the cohort) lived in more segregated areas (IoD, 0.67 vs 0.61; p &lt; 0.05). They were less likely to undergo surgery for localized disease (relative risk [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.83) and more frequently had a diagnosis of advanced-stage disease (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19) with increasing segregation. They also had shorter survival times (9.8 vs 11.4 months; p &lt; 0.05). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Disparities in advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, surgery for localized disease, and overall survival are directly related to the degree of residential segregation, a proxy for structural racism. In searching for solutions to this problem, it is important to account for the historical marginalization of black Americans.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Black Americans are at increased risk of chronic pancreatitis (CP) compared to their White counterparts. We aimed to describe the race-specific smoking history and lifetime drinking in patients diagnosed with CP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed data on 334 Black and White CP participants of the North American Pancreatitis Study 2 Continuation and Validation Study and Ancillary Study. Lifetime drinking history and lifetime smoking history were collected through in-person interviews. Intensity, frequency, duration and current status of drinking and smoking were compared between Black and White CP participants, stratified by physician-defined alcohol etiology. In addition, drinking levels at each successive decades in life (20s, 30s, 40s) were compared by race and graphically portrayed as heat diagrams. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among patients with alcoholic CP, current smoking levels were not different by race (67-70%), but a smaller proportion of Black patients reported having smoked 1 or more packs per day in the past (32%) as compared to White patients (58%, p &lt; 0.0001). Black patients were more likely to report current consumption of alcohol (31%), as opposed to White patients (17%, p = 0.016). Black patients also reported more intense drinking at age 35 and 45 years as compared to White patients, while age at CP onset were similar between the two groups. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We found more intense drinking but less intense smoking history in Black CP patients as compared to White CP patients. Effective alcohol abstinence and smoking cessation program with sustained impact are needed in CP patients.</p>

<p>At 2:00 h on Oct 31, 1920, Frederick G Banting, a surgeon practising in London, ON, Canada, conceived an idea to isolate the internal secretion of the pancreas. The following week, he met with noted scientist John J R Macleod in Toronto, ON, Canada, and they developed a research plan. By August, 1921, Banting and his student assistant Charles H Best had prepared an effective extract from a canine pancreas. In January, 1922, biochemist James B Collip isolated insulin that was sufficiently pure for human use. On Oct 25, 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of insulin. Here, we recount the most relevant events before and after the fateful early morning of Oct 31, 1920, which culminated in the discovery and clinical use of insulin.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The classification of epithelioid pancreatic neoplasms based on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is important for proper management, as distinction of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms from other similar appearing lesions can result in significantly different treatment. Mixed acinar-endocrine carcinomas (MAEC) are genetically related to acinar carcinomas and are treated as such. We reviewed cases of MAEC to better characterize their cytologic and immunohistochemical features. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Eight FNAs of MAECs were identified and reviewed. A chart review for each case was conducted. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:All patients were male, 42-68 years of age, and presented with either Stage 3 or 4 disease. Smear backgrounds of all cases showed naked nuclei without significant necrosis. The smears were cellular with cells arranged in either three-dimensional (3D) clusters with intervening capillaries or singly dispersed. Acinar formation was a prominent feature. Cells were round to oval with small to moderate amounts of delicate cytoplasm. The nuclei were round to oval with mild to moderate anisonucleosis with granular chromatin and small nucleoli. Apoptotic bodies and mitoses were noted in most cases, with Ki67 indices of 10%-48%. All tumors, by definition, demonstrated expression of trypsin and synaptophysin with variable chromogranin expression (50%). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The cytology of acinar cell carcinoma shares features with aspirates of other nonductal adenocarcinoma neoplasms of the pancreas. A clue to the diagnosis is that tumors show high Ki67 indices and a diagnosis of MAEC should be excluded anytime a diagnosis of Grade 2 or 3 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma is in the differential.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The clinical implications of pre- and postoperative KRAS-mutated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) present in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have remained an unresolved issue. This study sought to investigate the clinical significance of pre- and postoperative ctDNA analyses and their impact on the prognosis of PDAC patients. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction detected ctDNA in pre- and postoperative plasma samples prospectively obtained from patients with resectable and borderline-resectable PDAC. Its associations with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. The patients were sorted according to the presence of pre- and postoperative ctDNA, and its ability to stratify prognosis was evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The study analyzed 97 patients. Both pre- and postoperative ctDNA were detected in 9 patients, and neither was detected in 55 patients. Whereas 15 patients harbored only preoperative ctDNA, 18 patients had only postoperative ctDNA. The multivariate analysis showed that the presence of preoperative ctDNA was associated with poorer OS (P = 0.008) and that postoperative ctDNA was not associated with either RFS or OS. Survival did not differ significantly between the patients with a positive shift in ctDNA status and those without detectable pre- or postoperative ctDNA. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:For the patients with PDAC, the presence of preoperative ctDNA was significantly associated poor OS, whereas postoperative ctDNA was not associated with poor survival. A positive change in ctDNA did not affect patients’ survival.</p>

<p>Inhibition of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in combination with blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 T cell checkpoint induces T cell infiltration and anticancer responses in murine and human pancreatic cancer. Here we elucidate the mechanism by which CXCR4 inhibition affects the tumor immune microenvironment. In human immune cell-based chemotaxis assays, we find that CXCL12-stimulated CXCR4 inhibits the directed migration mediated by CXCR1, CXCR3, CXCR5, CXCR6, and CCR2, respectively, chemokine receptors expressed by all of the immune cell types that participate in an integrated immune response. Inhibiting CXCR4 in an experimental cancer medicine study by 1-wk continuous infusion of the small-molecule inhibitor AMD3100 (plerixafor) induces an integrated immune response that is detected by transcriptional analysis of paired biopsies of metastases from patients with microsatellite stable colorectal and pancreatic cancer. This integrated immune response occurs in three other examples of immune-mediated damage to noninfected tissues: Rejecting renal allografts, melanomas clinically responding to anti-PD1 antibody therapy, and microsatellite instable colorectal cancers. Thus, signaling by CXCR4 causes immune suppression in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer by impairing the function of the chemokine receptors that mediate the intratumoral accumulation of immune cells.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although rapid progress has been achieved in laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) over the last decade, laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (LDPPHR) remains a challenging surgery that has been rarely reported due to not only requiring complicated pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) but also ensuring sufficient blood supplies to duodenum and common bile duct (CBD). We completed LDPPHR for 22 patients safely and efficiently with innovative techniques. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Clinical outcomes, including rate of conversion to laparotomy, time of residual pancreatic duct reconstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, and time of hospital stay, were collected for 22 consecutive patients who underwent LDPPHR with innovative techniques as follows: application of indocyanine green (ICG) to visualize and preserve CBD and the vessels supplying the duodenum and CBD, Hong’s PJ, and pancreatic duct end-to-end anastomosis (ETEA) for the residual pancreas. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:All surgeries were performed successfully under laparoscopy except for one case. The duration of ETEA was significantly shorter than PJ (18.2 ± 5.1 min versus 27.5 ± 8.3 min, p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in incidence of postoperative complications between the Hong’s PJ and ETEA group. The overall incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) in the Hong’s PJ and ETEA group was 23.5% and 20%, respectively, without grade C fistula. All complications were resolved after conservative treatment. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:By utilizing intraoperative ICG navigation, LDPPHR is a minimally invasive, safe, and efficient approach for chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic head stones by using pancreatic duct ETEA and benign or low-grade malignant tumors of the pancreatic head by using Hong’s PJ.</p>

<p>Pancreatic neurogenic tumors, including schwannoma and neurofibroma, are rare, and their genetic aberrances have not been defined. The present study aimed at investigating the genomic alterations of pancreatic schwannoma and neurofibroma. Two patients with pancreatic schwannoma and 1 patient with neurofibroma, who underwent surgical resection at the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between June 2016 and April 2019, were recruited into the study. Their tumor tissues were analyzed by exome sequencing and genome sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed a MUTYH likely pathogenic germline variant in 1 schwannoma with somatic NF2del and NOTCH1 amplification. Pathway enrichment analysis on the other schwannoma case showed that the main abnormal function involved DNA damage repair, mitosis, and cell cycle. In addition, genome sequencing showed the inversion (INV) variant of SPIRE gene and multiple mitochondrial INV variants in both schwannoma cases. Furthermore, exome sequencing revealed NF1del, single nucleotide variation, TP53, and ERBB3 amplification in neurofibroma, whereas genomic duplication/deletion variants and mitochondrial abnormalities were much less than that in schwannoma. In conclusion, variants in NF1 and NF2 genes, amplification of key driver genes, and somatic and mitochondrial INV variants may play important roles in the development of pancreatic schwannoma and neurofibroma.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cystic insulinoma is an uncommon tumor. Perioperative localization remained challenging if the tumor is atypical with cystic feature or in small size. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is a technique by injecting fluorescent dye intravenously, which accumulates to the target lesion and creating signal by laser sources. The signal helps surgeons to identify the lesion during operation, but little experience has been reported regarding the use of imaging NIR technique for localizing cystic insulinoma. We present a 29-year-old female patient with a symptomatic pancreatic cystic insulinoma (1.2 cm) as assessed by clinical symptom, laboratory evidence, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. With an aid of NIR imaging technique, this cystic tumor was localized easily at operation. Also, the fluorescence imaging visualized the tumor part, guided us to identify the safe margin, and preserved the normal pancreatic structure. Pathologic report confirmed that the tumor was a well-differentiated cystic insulinoma. This case demonstrates that pancreatic cystic insulinoma in small size can be intraoperatively localized by NIR imaging, a relatively safe and easy technique.</p>

<p>Historically, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPDAC) was considered a palliative condition. Advances in treatment have resulted in studies reporting survival after neoadjuvant treatment and surgery similar to earlier disease stages. However, there is no consensus on optimal LAPDAC management. Our aim was a systematic review of published evidence on LAPDAC treatment strategies with curative intent. Twenty-eight studies defining LAPDAC as per established criteria and reporting outcomes after neoadjuvant treatment with a view to resection were included. Primary outcomes were resection rate and proportion of curative resections. Secondary outcomes were postoperative mortality, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Neoadjuvant treatment varied significantly, most common being the combination of folinic acid, fluorouracil, irontecan, and oxaliplatin. Median percentage of patients proceeding to surgery after completion of neoadjuvant pathway was 33.5%. Median resection rate was 25%. Median R0 resection was 80% of resected patients. These outcomes ranged 0% to 100% across studies. Ninety-day postoperative mortality ranged from 0% to 5%. Median progression-free and overall survival for resected patients were 12.9 and 30 months, respectively, versus 13.2 months overall survival for unresected patients. In conclusion, although there is wide variability in reported LAPDAC resection rates post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, retrospective data suggest that neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery results in improved survival.</p>

<p><em>The adaptor protein APPL2 controls glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via F-actin remodeling in pancreatic β-cells. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2020 10;117(45)</em></p>
<p>PubMed: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33122440" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33122440</a></p>
<p>Filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeletal remodeling is critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β-cells, and its dysregulation causes type 2 diabetes. The adaptor protein APPL1 promotes first-phase GSIS by up-regulating soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein expression. However, whether APPL2 (a close homology of APPL1 with the same domain organization) plays a role in β-cell functions is unknown. Here, we show that APPL2 enhances GSIS by promoting F-actin remodeling via the small GTPase Rac1 in pancreatic β-cells. β-cell specific abrogation of APPL2 impaired GSIS, leading to glucose intolerance in mice. APPL2 deficiency largely abolished glucose-induced first- and second-phase insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Real-time live-cell imaging and phalloidin staining revealed that APPL2 deficiency abolished glucose-induced F-actin depolymerization in pancreatic islets. Likewise, knockdown of APPL2 expression impaired glucose-stimulated F-actin depolymerization and subsequent insulin secretion in INS-1E cells, which were attributable to the impairment of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation. Treatment with the F-actin depolymerization chemical compounds or overexpression of gelsolin (a F-actin remodeling protein) rescued APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS. In addition, APPL2 interacted with Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RacGAP1) in a glucose-dependent manner via the bin/amphiphysin/rvs-pleckstrin homology (BAR-PH) domain of APPL2 in INS-1E cells and HEK293 cells. Concomitant knockdown of RacGAP1 expression reverted APPL2 deficiency-induced defective GSIS, F-actin remodeling, and Rac1 activation in INS-1E cells. Our data indicate that APPL2 interacts with RacGAP1 and suppresses its negative action on Rac1 activity and F-actin depolymerization thereby enhancing GSIS in pancreatic β-cells.</p>

After screening databases for randomized controlled trials/RCT, studies were stratified into pancreatic resection techniques and data were pooled in meta-analyses containing subgroups of octreotide, somatostatin, lanreotide, pasireotide and vapreotide. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The meta-analysis of studies with a mixed cohort of patients after pancreatic resection revealed a protective effect of somatostatin analogues for morbidity (RR: 0.71, p &lt; .00001) but not for mortality (RR: 1.07, = 0.78) or intra-abdominal abscesses (RR: 1.00, p = 1.00). Moreover, no effect was visible for mortality (RR: 1.57, p = .15), morbidity (RR: 0.87, p = .15) and intra-abdominal abscesses (RR: 0.92, p = .48) after PD. The meta-analysis of patients after PD revealed no impact of somatostatin analogues on POPF (RR: 0.87, p = .19) and clinically relevant POPF (RR: 0.69, p = .30). However, treatment with somatostatin analogues in the mixed cohort showed less POPF (RR: 0.60, p &lt; .00001) and clinically relevant POPF (RR: 0.47, p = .02), which was also the case after DP (RR: 0.41, p = .03). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Somatostatin analogues did not affect POPF and clinically relevant POPF after PD, but seemed to be associated with less POPF after DP. As no sufficiently powered RCT could be identified by the systematic review, further RCTs are urgently needed to investigate the effect of somatostatin analogues after DP.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:To the authors’ knowledge, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cytopathology practices worldwide has not been investigated formally. In the current study, data from 41 respondents from 23 countries were reported. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Data regarding the activity of each cytopathology laboratory during 4 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown were collected and compared with those obtained during the corresponding period in 2019. The overall number and percentage of exfoliative and fine-needle aspiration cytology samples from each anatomic site were recorded. Differences in the malignancy and suspicious rates between the 2 periods were analyzed using a meta-analytical approach. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, the sample volume was lower compared with 2019 (104,319 samples vs 190,225 samples), with an average volume reduction of 45.3% (range, 0.1%-98.0%). The percentage of samples from the cervicovaginal tract, thyroid, and anorectal region was significantly reduced (P &lt; .05). Conversely, the percentage of samples from the urinary tract, serous cavities, breast, lymph nodes, respiratory tract, salivary glands, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and biliary tract increased (P &lt; .05). An overall increase of 5.56% (95% CI, 3.77%-7.35%) in the malignancy rate in nongynecological samples during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed. When the suspicious category was included, the overall increase was 6.95% (95% CI, 4.63%-9.27%). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a drastic reduction in the total number of cytology specimens regardless of anatomic site or specimen type. The rate of malignancy increased, reflecting the prioritization of patients with cancer who were considered to be at high risk.

Therefore, nearly, all solid tumors have a heterogeneous fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, which consists of myofibroblastic cells, extracellular matrix components, and infiltrates from various types of immune cell. In particular, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a prototype of a tumor with a pronounced inflammatory microenvironment, in which the majority of the tumor mass consists of nonneoplastic stromal and immune cells. Our own data and data from the literature indicate a protective role of tumor-infiltrating T cells for the host. On the other hand, we were able to show that a defined T cell subpopulation paradoxically promotes the progression of the tumor. Our investigations now focus on these cells, known as “Th17,” in the tumor microenvironment. Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To elucidate the mechanisms of the infiltrated immune cells and their mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Human pancreatic cancer tissue was used for (immune) histological staining and morphometric analysis and the results were correlated with clinical parameters and with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging images. The molecular mechanisms were analyzed in cell culture approaches using human tumor cells and human immune cells. With molecular biological methods and functional assays cell growth, invasion and colony formation were assessed. The in vivo correlation of the results and functional interventions were tested in murine and avian (xenograft) models. Label=“RESULTS AND CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Tumor-infiltrating immune cells of type Th17 and their mediators promoted the progression of the tumor depending on density, activation status, and cytokine profile. On molecular level, we identified a Th17-mediated increase of tumor cell migration and invasion, an increased neoangiogenesis, as well as a reorganization of the tumor stroma and microarchitecture. The data show that the progression of pancreatic cancer, depends on the status of activation and the cytokine profile of the infiltrated T cells.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Nowadays, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), and fine needle biopsy (FNB) are considered the best procedures for the diagnosis of biliopancreatic lesions. These methods represent a milestone since they proved to be both safe for the patient and useful to achieve diagnostic material useful to plan the best treatment strategy. Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Since in the literature, a debate between cytology and histology supporters is still ongoing and the trend is changing in favor of FNB, we would like to present our experience about the diagnostic yield of FNA and FNB. The aim of our study is to highlight FNA versus FNB diagnostic role of biliopancreatic lesions, highlight advantages, and drawbacks of these procedures, and our view on these 2 procedures and whether they should still be considered complementary or opposing techniques. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively reviewed our hospital series of 469 EUS diagnostics procedures of biliopancreatic lesions performed in 419 patients, between 2015 and 2019. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The overall adequacy rates of FNA and FNB were, respectively, 98.9 and 100%. Stratifying cases according to anatomic location of the mass (pancreas vs. biliary system), we detected 168 malignancies out of 349 pancreatic lesions (168/349; 48.1%), while biliary system cases positive for malignancy represented 33.8% (23/68 cases) (p value = 0.045, χ2 test). As for concomitant FNB, our series displayed a high rate of diagnostic concordance (88.8%). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Despite numerous data published, it is still unclear which is the most feasible method to use; therefore, we compared FNA, FNB, or their combination to understand the best applicable technique. Our experience confirmed that FNA is extremely efficient in the diagnosis of biliopancreatic lesions, especially in the hands of expert endoscopists and pathologists. Considering anatomic location, EUS-FNA is more accurate for mass-forming neoplasms in the pancreatic parenchyma rather than for lesions of the biliary system. Moreover, concomitant FNB usually confirmed the cytological diagnosis, allowing a deeper immunohistochemical characterization of the neoplasia. This proves that a “pure” cytology and “pure” histology approach should be looked differently since these are complementary techniques especially if we can obtain a cellblock from FNA.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:In the absence of rapid on-side pathological evaluation, endoscopy staff generally “smears” endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) specimens on a glass slide. As this technique is vulnerable to preparation artifacts, we assessed if its quality could be improved through a smear-preparation-training for endoscopy staff. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In this prospective pilot study, 10 endosonographers and 12 endoscopy nurses from seven regional EUS-centers in the Netherlands were invited to participate in a EUS-FNA smear-preparation-training. Subsequently, post training slides derived from solid pancreatic lesions were compared to pre-training “control” slides. Primary outcome was to assess if the training positively affects smear quality and, consequently, diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Participants collected and prepared 71 cases, mostly pancreatic head lesions (48%). Sixty-eight controls were selected from the pretraining period. The presence of artifacts was comparable for smears performed before and after training (76% vs 82%, P = .36). Likewise, smear cellularity (≥50% target cells) before and after training did not differ (44% (30/68) vs 49% (35/71), P = .48). Similar, no difference in diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was detected (P = .10). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In this pilot EUS-FNA smear-preparation-training for endoscopy personnel, smear quality and diagnostic accuracy were not improved after the training. Based on these results, we plan to further study other training programs and possibilities.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging cancers to treat. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and lack of curative treatment modalities, the 5-y survival rate of PDAC patients is one of the lowest of any cancer type. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted. Therefore, identification of effective drug combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify gene targets whose inhibition creates synergistic tumor growth inhibition with gemcitabine (Gem), a first- or second-line chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as an effective druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition indicate that loss of PRMT5 activity synergistically enhances Gem cytotoxicity due to the accumulation of excessive DNA damage. At the molecular level, we show that inhibition of PRMT5 results in RPA depletion and impaired homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) activity. The combination (Gem + PRMT5 inhibition) creates conditional lethality and synergistic reduction of PDAC tumors in vivo. The findings demonstrate that unbiased genetic screenings combined with a clinically relevant model system is a practical approach in identifying synthetic lethal drug combinations for cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Label=“AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal malignancies. Hence, there is a need for new markers and treatment strategies. P68/DEAD box protein 5 (DDX5) is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the DEAD box protein family. It is a prognostic marker for several cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression and clinical relevance of DDX5 in PDAC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:DDX5 expression in tissue microarray blocks containing 230 PDAC samples was examined using immunohistochemical analysis. DDX5 expression was considered high when more than 50% of the cells were stained and low when less than 50% of the cells were stained. We investigated the association between DDX5 expression and clinicopathological parameters, including patient survival. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The nuclei of normal pancreatic ducts, normal acinar cells and PDAC cells were stained positive for DDX5 although the intensity and distribution of DDX5 expression varied. Islet cells showed strong and diffuse staining of DDX5. DDX5 expression was low and high in 148 (64.3%) and 82 cases (35.7%), respectively. Low DDX5 expression was significantly associated with an advanced pT factor (pT2-pT3: tumour size,&gt;20 mm), lymphatic involvement, advanced tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (stages IIB, III, and IV), and venous involvement. In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that DDX5 expression is an independent prognostic factor for PDAC. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:These results suggest that DDX5 plays an important role in tumour invasiveness and PDAC prognosis.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The identification of genetic risk factors for chronic pancreatitis, such as PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1, provides the opportunity to define key pathologic hallmarks and etiologic-specific changes. For example, pancreata from PRSS1 and CFTR patients exhibit progressive lipomatous atrophy without significant fibrosis. Considering the pathology of SPINK1-associated pancreatitis is ill-defined, we examined the pancreata of SPINK1 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Histologic sections after total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation and associated clinicopathologic data were collected from 28 patients with SPINK1 germline alterations. Clinical findings, germline data, anatomic anomalies and pathologic findings were descriptively evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Patients ranged in age from 5 to 48 years (median, 21.6 years) with abdominal pain between 2 and 25 years (median, 5.8 years). Most patients were SPINK1 heterozygous and 14 (50%) had co-occurring CFTR (n = 12) and CTRC (n = 2) mutations. Other pancreatitis risk factors included anatomic anomalies (n = 9) and tobacco use (n = 1). Overall, 24 (86%) patients had additional pancreatitis-associated germline alterations, SPINK1 homozygosity, anatomic anomalies or environmental factors. Examination of pancreata revealed a sequential pattern of exocrine parenchymal loss and replacement by prominent fibrosis, dependent on the duration of abdominal pain. No malignancies were identified, but low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia was present for 2 cases. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Within this descriptive study, SPINK1-associated pancreatitis is characterized by parenchymal fibrosis and suggests divergent pathophysiologic mechanisms from PRSS1 and CFTR-associated pancreatitis. Moreover, SPINK1 patients frequently had additional etiologic factors that did not impact the development of pancreatic fibrosis and may implicate SPINK1 as a disease modifier gene.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Acute pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disorder of high incidence resulting in life threatening complications in up to 20% of patients. Its severe form is characterized by an extensive and systemic immune response. We investigated the role of the adaptive immune response in two experimental models of pancreatitis. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In C57BI/6-mice mild pancreatitis was induced by 8-hourly injections of caerulein and severe pancreatitis by additional, partial pancreatic duct ligation. T-cell-activation was determined by flow-cytometry of CD25/CD69, T-cell-differentiation by nuclear staining of the transcription-factors Tbet, Gata3 and Foxp3. In vivo CD4+ T-cells were depleted using anti-CD4 antibody. Disease severity was determined by histology, serum amylase and lipase activities, lung MPO and serum cytokine levels (IL-6, TNFα, IL-10). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In both models T-cells were activated. Th1-differentiation (Tbet) was absent during pancreatitis but we detected a pronounced Th2/Treg (Gata3/Foxp3) response which paralleled disease severity in both models. The complete depletion of CD4+ T-cells via anti-CD4 antibody, surprisingly, reduced disease severity significantly, as well as granulocyte infiltration and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. Co-incubation of acini and T-cells did not lead to T-cell-activation by acinar cells but to acinar damage by T-cells. During pancreatitis no significant T-cell-infiltration into the pancreas was observed. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:T cells orchestrate the early local as well as the systemic immune responses in pancreatitis and are directly involved in organ damage. The Th2 response appears to increase disease severity, rather than conferring an immunological protection.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:For most patients, pancreatic adenocarcinoma responds poorly to treatment, and novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Standard-of-care paclitaxel (PTX), combined with birinapant (BRP), a bivalent mimetic of the apoptosis antagonist SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases), exerts synergistic killing of PANC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:To investigate potential mechanisms underlying this synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction, data capturing PANC-1 cell growth, apoptosis kinetics, and cell cycle distribution were integrated with high-quality IonStar-generated proteomic data capturing changes in the relative abundance of more than 3300 proteins as the cells responded to the two drugs, alone and combined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:PTX alone (15 nM) elicited dose-dependent G2/M-phase arrest and cellular polyploidy. Combined BRP/PTX (150/15 nM) reduced G2/M by 35% and polyploid cells by 45%, and increased apoptosis by 20%. Whereas BRP or PTX alone produced no change in the pro-apoptotic protein pJNK, and a slight increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, the drug combination increased pJNK and decreased Bcl2 significantly compared to the vehicle control. A multi-scale, mechanism-based mathematical model was developed to investigate integrated birinapant/paclitaxel effects on temporal profiles of key proteins involved in kinetics of cell growth, death, and cell cycle distribution. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The model, consistent with the observed reduction in the Bcl2/BAX ratio, suggests that BRP-induced apoptosis of mitotically-arrested cells is a major contributor to the synergy between BRP and PTX. Coupling proteomic and cellular response profiles with multi-scale pharmacodynamic modeling provides a quantitative mechanistic framework for evaluating pharmacodynamically-based drug-drug interactions in combination chemotherapy, and could potentially guide the development of promising drug regimens.</p>

<p>Label=“Objectives” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Biological behavior of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan NETs) is difficult to predict on morphology alone. The assessment of proliferation by the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) is considered to be an important prognostic parameter in these tumors and has been endorsed by the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for Pan NETs. Although widely accepted on surgical specimens, there is varied opinion on grading of these tumors on cytology samples. This study aimed at classification and grading of Pan NETs on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) using the recent 2017 WHO criteria and assess the reliability of Ki-67 grading by comparing it with histology samples wherever available. Label=“Material and Methods” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Search of cytopathology lab records over a 3-year period (June 2015-May 2018) revealed 33 cases of pancreatic NETs diagnosed on EUS-FNA specimens. Using the guidelines of 2017 WHO classification and grading of Pan NETs, retrospective grading of these Pan NETs was done. They were graded as Grades 1, 2, and 3 well differentiated Pan NETs and poorly differentiated Grade 3 neoplasms based on Ki-67 PI and cytomorphology. Cytomorphological features were compared across the three grades. The cytological grading was then compared with the histological grading where available. Label=“Results” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Ki-67 grading on cytology was done in 32 cases (22 on cell block and 10 on smears), of which 19 (59.4%) were Grade 1, 8 (25%) were Grade 2, and 5 (15.6%) were Grade 3 tumors. The most common cytomorphological features observed in Grade 1 tumors were small round uniform cells with granular chromatin and prominent plasmacytoid morphology. As the grade increased, tumor cells showed increased pleomorphism, angulated nuclei, and less frequent plasmacytoid cells. Histopathology (biopsy/resected specimens) was available in 11 of the 32 cases. Comparison of grading on cytology and histology showed concordance in ten of the 11 cases (k value = 0.862). Label=“Conclusion” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Our data suggest that grading of Pan NETs by assessing Ki-67 PI on cytology samples collected by EUS-FNA shows good agreement with that measured on histology samples.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest cancer. Cancer-associated thrombosis/thromboembolism (CAT), frequently observed in PDAC, is known as a poor prognostic factor. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms between PDAC and CAT, and performed a trial of therapeutic approach for PDAC using a genetically engineered mouse model, PKF (Ptf1acre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tgfbr2flox/flox ). Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Presence of CAT in PKF mice was detected by systemic autopsy. Plasma cytokines were screened by cytokine antibody array. Murine and human plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) were determined by ELISA. Distribution of VCAM-1 in PKF mice and human autopsy samples was detected by immunohistochemistry. PKF mice were treated with anti-VCAM-1 antibody and the effects on survival, distribution of CAT and the tumour histology were analysed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found spontaneous CAT with cardiomegaly in 68.4% PKF mice. Increase of plasma ANP and sVCAM-1 was observed in PKF mice and PDAC patients with CAT. VCAM-1 was detected in the activated endothelium and thrombi. Administration of anti-VCAM-1 antibody to PKF mice inhibited tumour growth, neutrophil/macrophage infiltration, tumour angiogenesis and progression of CAT; moreover, it dramatically extended survival (from 61 to 253 days, p&lt;0.01). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Blocking VCAM-1/sVCAM-1 might be a potent therapeutic approach for PDAC as well as CAT, which can contribute to the prognosis. Increase of plasma ANP and sVCAM-1 might be a diagnostic approach for CAT in PDAC.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Conjugated bile acids are metabolised by upper small intestinal microbiota, and serum levels of taurine-conjugated bile acids are elevated and correlated with insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes. However, whether changes in taurine-conjugated bile acids are necessary for small intestinal microbiome to alter insulin action remain unknown. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We evaluated circulating and specifically brain insulin action using the pancreatic-euglycaemic clamps in high-fat (HF) versus chow fed rats with or without upper small intestinal healthy microbiome transplant. Chemical and molecular gain/loss-of-function experiments targeting specific taurine-conjugated bile acid-induced changes of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the brain were performed in parallel. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found that short-term HF feeding increased the levels of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA, an FXR ligand) in the upper small intestine, ileum, plasma and dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the brain. Transplantation of upper small intestinal healthy microbiome into the upper small intestine of HF rats not only reversed the rise of TCDCA in all reported tissues but also enhanced the ability of either circulating hyperinsulinaemia or DVC insulin action to lower glucose production. Further, DVC infusion of TCDCA or FXR agonist negated the enhancement of insulin action, while genetic knockdown or chemical inhibition of FXR in the DVC of HF rats reversed insulin resistance. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our findings indicate that FXR in the DVC is sufficient and necessary for upper small intestinal microbiome-mediated changes of TCDCA to alter insulin action in rats, and highlight a previously unappreciated TCDCA-FXR axis linking gut microbiome and host insulin action.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Early gastric carcinoma is heterogeneous and can be divided into early gastric cardiac carcinoma (EGCC) and early gastric non-cardiac carcinoma (EGNCC) groups. At present, differences in clinicopathology remains obscure between EGCC and EGNCC fundus-corpus and antrum-angularis-pylorus subgroups, especially between EGCC with and without oesophageal invasion. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In this study, we studied 329 consecutive early gastric carcinoma radical gastrectomies with 70 EGCCs and 259 EGNCCs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Compared to the EGNCC antrum-angularis-pylorus (n = 181), but not fundus-corpus (n = 78), sub-group, EGCC showed significantly older age, lower prevalence of the grossly depressed pattern, better tumor differentiation, higher percentage of tubular/papillary adenocarcinoma, but lower frequency of mixed poorly cohesive carcinoma with tubular/papillary adenocarcinoma, and absence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in tumors with invasion up to superficial submucosa (SM1). In contrast, pure poorly cohesive carcinoma was less frequently seen in EGCCs than in EGNCCs, but mixed poorly cohesive carcinoma with tubular/papillary adenocarcinomas was significantly more common in the EGNCC antrum-angularis-pylorus sub-group than in any other group. No significant differences were found between EGCC and EGNCC sub-groups in gender, tumor size, H. pylori infection rate, and lymphovascular/perineural invasion. EGCC with oesophageal invasion (n = 22), compared to EGCC without (n = 48), showed no significant differences in the H. pylori infection rate and oesophageal columnar, intestinal, or pancreatic metaplasia, except for a higher percentage of the former in size &gt; 2 cm and tubular differentiation. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:There exist distinct clinicopathologic differences between EGCC and EGNCC sub-groups; EGCC was indeed of gastric origin. Further investigations with larger samples are needed to validate these findings.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To describe PNI and to evaluate its impact on disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although PNI is a prognostic factor for survival in many GI cancers, there is limited knowledge regarding its impact on tumor recurrence, especially in “early stage disease” (PDAC ≤20 mm, R0/N0 PDAC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This multicenter retrospective study included patients undergoing PDAC resection between 2009 and 2014. The association of PNI with DFS and OS was analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:PNI was found in 87% of 778 patients included in the study, with lower rates in PDAC ≤20 mm (78.7%) and in R0/N0 tumors (70.6%). PNI rate did not differ between patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and upfront surgery (88% vs 84%, P = 0.08). Although not significant at multivariate analysis (P = 0.07), patients with PNI had worse DFS at univariate analysis (median DFS: 20 vs 15 months, P &lt; 0.01). PNI was the only independent predictor of DFS in R0/N0 tumors (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.2) and in PDAC ≤20 mm (HR: 1.8). PNI was an independent predictor of OS in the entire cohort (27 vs 50 months, P = 0.01), together with G3 tumors, pN1 status, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9 &gt;37 and pain. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PNI represents a major determinant of tumor recurrence and patients’ survival in pancreatic cancer. The role of PNI is particularly relevant in early stages, supporting the hypothesis that invasion of nerves by cancer cells has a driving role in pancreatic cancer progression.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Biliary stricture in necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) has not been systematically categorized; therefore, we sought to define the incidence and natural history of biliary stricture caused by NP. Label=“SUMMARY/BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Benign biliary stricture occurs secondary to bile duct injury, anastomotic narrowing, or chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The profound loco-regional inflammatory response of NP creates challenging biliary strictures. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:NP patients treated between 2005-2019 were reviewed. Biliary stricture was identified on cholangiography as narrowing of the extrahepatic biliary tree to &lt; 75% of the diameter of the unaffected duct. Biliary stricture risk factors and outcomes were evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among 743 NP patients, 64 died, 13 were lost to follow up; therefore, a total of 666 patients were included in the final cohort. Biliary stricture developed in 108 (16%) patients. Mean follow up was 3.5 ± 3.3 years. Median time from NP onset to biliary stricture diagnosis was 4.2 months (IQR, 1.8-10.9). Presentation was commonly clinical or biochemical jaundice, n = 30 (28%) each. Risk factors for stricture development were splanchnic vein thrombosis and pancreatic head parenchymal necrosis. Median time to stricture resolution was 6.0 months after onset (2.8-9.8). A mean of 3.3 ± 2.3 procedures were performed. Surgical intervention was required in 22 (20%) patients. Endoscopic treatment failed in 17% (17/99) of patients and was not associated with stricture length. Operative treatment of biliary stricture was more likely in patients with infected necrosis or NP disease duration ≥6 months. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Biliary stricture occurs frequently after necrotizing pancreatitis and is associated with splanchnic vein thrombosis and pancreatic head necrosis. Surgical correction was performed in 20%.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The objective of this study was to characterize the patterns of first recurrence after curative-intent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:We evaluated the first site of recurrence after neoadjuvant treatment as locoregional (LR) or distant metastasis (DM). To validate our findings, we evaluated the pattern from two phase II clinical trials evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in PDAC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We identified site of first recurrence from a retrospective cohort of patients from 2011-2017 treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and then an operation or an operation first followed by adjuvant therapy, as well as two separate prospective cohorts of patients derived from two phase II clinical trials evaluating patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in borderline-resectable and locally advanced PDAC RESULTS:: In the retrospective cohorts, 160 out of 285 patients (56.1%) recurred after a median disease-free survival (mDFS) of 17.2 months. The pattern of recurrence was DM in 81.9% of patients, versus LR in 11.1%. This pattern was consistent in patients treated with upfront resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (DM 83.0%, LR 16.9%) regardless of margin-involvement (DM 80.1%, LR 19.4%). The use of NAC did not alter pattern of recurrence; 81.7% had DM and 18.3% had LR. This pattern also remained consistent regardless of margin-involvement (DM 94.1%, LR 5.9%). In the Phase II borderline-resectable trial (NCI# 01591733) cohort of 32 patients, the mDFS was 34.2 months. Pattern of recurrence remained predominantly DM (88.9%) versus LR (11.1%). In the Phase II locally-advanced trial (NCI# 01821729) cohort of 34 patients, the mDFS was 30.7 months. Although there was a higher rate of local recurrence in this cohort, pattern of first recurrence remained predominantly DM (66.6%) versus LR (33.3%) and remained consistent independent of margin-status. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The pattern of recurrence in PDAC is predominantly DM rather than LR, and is consistent regardless of the use of NAC and margin involvement.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Modified Appleby procedure could be indicated in stage III locally advanced body pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) involving the celiac axis after neoadjuvant treatment. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We report the case of a 38-year-old woman presenting a tumor arising from the body of the pancreas, involving the celiac trunk with the common hepatic artery and having contact with the anterior surface of the superior mesenteric artery. A fine-needle aspirate biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PADC. Eight cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy) were conducted. After 6 months, the CA19-9 levels were normalized, and the tumor remained stable without local growth or distant metastasis. To reduce the risk of ischemia-related complications and develop the pancreaticoduodenal arcades, a preoperative embolization of the common hepatic artery was performed. Then, surgical resection was considered 4 weeks after embolization. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The patient underwent a modified Appleby procedure including distal splenopancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection combined with lateral portal vein resection. Venous reconstruction was carried out using peritoneal patch.1 Pathologic evaluation revealed a 2.5-cm PDAC with negative resection margins. Postoperative course was marked by acute ischemic cholecystitis requiring reoperation at postoperative day 3. The treatment was completed with four cycles of FOLFIRINOX, and she was free of disease 6 months after surgery. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Nowadays, modified Appleby procedure is more frequently performed due to improvements in responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy which have led to better local control and more aggressive approaches in highly selected patients.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To evaluate somatic mutations, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the PDAC patients with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and find their associations with outcome. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Thirty-six PDAC patients with pCR were identified from 2009 to 2017. Macro-dissection was performed on resected specimens to isolate DNA from 332 regions of interest including fibrosis, normal duct, normal parenchyma, and undefined ductal cells (UDCs). Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and CTCs were also extracted. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to detect mutations of KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, TP53, GNAS, and BRAF Results: KRAS mutation was detected in UDCs and fibrosis while SMAD4, TP53 and GNAS were only seen in UDCs. Patients with TP53 mutation showed relatively worse overall survival (OS) (HR=3.596, 95%=0.855-15.130, P=0.081). Five patients available for CTCs data were all positive for CTCs and seven of 16 pCR patients were detected with ctDNA at surgery. We proposed a new concept of regression assessment combining genomic analysis of resected specimens and liquid biopsy data for PDAC, namely molecular complete response (mCR). Three of six mCR patients recurred as compared with six in fifteen non-mCR patients. Seven of 15 non-mCR patients died during follow-up while there was only one in six mCR patients.

Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Thirty-six PDAC patients with pCR were identified from 2009 to 2017. Macro-dissection was performed on resected specimens to isolate DNA from 332 regions of interest including fibrosis, normal duct, normal parenchyma, and undefined ductal cells (UDCs). Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and CTCs were also extracted. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to detect mutations of KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, TP53, GNAS, and BRAF Results: KRAS mutation was detected in UDCs and fibrosis while SMAD4, TP53 and GNAS were only seen in UDCs. Patients with TP53 mutation showed relatively worse overall survival (OS) (HR=3.596, 95%=0.855-15.130, P=0.081). Five patients available for CTCs data were all positive for CTCs and seven of 16 pCR patients were detected with ctDNA at surgery. We proposed a new concept of regression assessment combining genomic analysis of resected specimens and liquid biopsy data for PDAC, namely molecular complete response (mCR). Three of six mCR patients recurred as compared with six in fifteen non-mCR patients. Seven of 15 non-mCR patients died during follow-up while there was only one in six mCR patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study firstly reports that somatic mutations, CTCs and ctDNA existed even in PDAC patients with pCR to NAT, which could possibly predict early recurrence and reduced survival. The current regression evaluation system of PDAC needs to be re-assessed at a molecular level.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND AND AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Despite recent advances, patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers have a poor prognosis. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided acquisition of portal vein (PV) blood for enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The aim of this study was to assess PV-CTCs as potential biomarkers for the assessment of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:17 patients with biopsy-proven pancreaticobiliary malignancy were enrolled. CTCs were enumerated from both peripheral and PV blood. All patients were followed until death. PFS and OS were evaluated with the log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox-proportional hazards models were fitted to study the relationship between PV-CTCs and PFS and OS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:After 3.5 years of follow-up, all patients had expired. PV-CTCs were detected in all patients (median PV-CTCs 62.0/7.5 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 17-132). The mean PFS in patients with PV-CTCs &lt;185/7.5 mL was significantly longer than patients with PV-CTCs ≥185/7.5 mL (43.3 weeks vs. 12.8 weeks, log-rank p = 0.002). The mean OS in patients with PV-CTCs &lt;185/7.5 mL was significantly longer than patients with PV-CTCs ≥185/7.5 mL (75.8 weeks vs. 29.5 weeks, log-rank p = 0.021). In an adjusted Cox-proportional hazards model, PV-CTCs were significant predictors of both PFS and OS (HR 1.004, p = 0.037; HR 1.004, p = 0.044 respectively). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In this pilot and feasibility study, EUS-acquired PV-CTCs predicted PFS and OS. Our findings suggest that PV-CTCs can help provide important prognostic data for both providers and patients.</p>

<p>Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are an increasingly important public health problem. The majority of these lesions are benign but some progress to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). There is a dearth of mouse models of these conditions. The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 regulates development, differentiation, and inflammation. Germline Nr5a2 heterozygosity sensitizes mice to the oncogenic effects of mutant Kras in the pancreas. Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras (KPN+/- ), leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high-grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6, but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2, and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC. These results highlight that the effects of loss of one Nr5a2 allele are time- and cell context-dependent. KPN+/- mice represent a new model to study the formation of cystic pancreatic lesions and their relationship with PanINs and classical PDAC. Our findings suggest that pancreatitis could also contribute to acceleration of cystic tumour progression in patients. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:A novel technique of single-layer continuous suturing (SCS) for pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) during robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD), a technically straightforward procedure, has been shown to produce promising results in a previous study. The present RCT aims to show that SCS during RPD does not increase the incidence of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) when compared with modified Blumgart anastomosis (MBA). Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Between January 2019 and September 2019, consecutive patients (ASA score ≤ 2) who underwent RPD were enrolled and randomized to the SCS or the MBA group. The primary endpoint was the rate of CR-POPF. A noninferiority margin of 10% was chosen. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 186 patients, 4 were excluded because PJ was not performed. The remaining 182 patients were randomized to the SCS group (n = 89) or MBA group (n = 93). CR-POPF rate was not inferior in the SCS group [SCS: 6.7%, MBA: 11.8%; 95% confidence interval (- 0.76, - 0.06), P = 0.0002]. PJ duration was significantly lower in the SCS group (P &lt; 0.01). No significant differences were found between the two groups in operative time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, or rates of conversion to laparotomy, morbidity, reoperation, or mortality. On subgroup analysis of patients with a soft pancreas and small main pancreatic duct, SCS significantly reduced the duration of PJ.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Consensus guidelines recommend surveillance of high-risk individuals (HRIs) for pancreatic cancer (PC) using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study aims to assess the yield of PC surveillance programs of HRIs and compare the detection of high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma by EUS and MRI. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The MEDLINE and Embase (Ovid) databases were searched for prospective studies published up to April 11, 2019 using EUS and/or MRI to screen HRIs for PC. Baseline detection of focal pancreatic abnormalities, cystic lesions, solid lesions, high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma, and all pancreatic adenocarcinoma were recorded. Weighted pooled proportions of outcomes detected were compared between EUS and MRI using random effects modeling. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 1097 studies were reviewed and 24 were included, representing 2112 HRIs who underwent imaging. The weighted pooled proportion of focal pancreatic abnormalities detected by baseline EUS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30-0.37) was significantly higher (p = 0.006) than by MRI (0.31, 95% CI 0.28-0.33). There were no significant differences between EUS and MRI in detection of other outcomes. The overall weighted pooled proportion of patients with high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma detected at baseline (regardless of imaging modality) was 0.0090 (95% CI 0.0022-0.016), corresponding to a number-needed-to-screen (NNS) of 111 patients to detect one high-grade dysplasia or T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIM” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), are produced by non-oxidative alcohol metabolism and can cause acinar cell damage and subsequent acute pancreatitis in rodent models. Even though experimental studies have elucidated the FAEE mediated early intra-acinar events, these mechanisms have not been well studied in humans. In the present study, we evaluate the early intra-acinar events and inflammatory response in human pancreatic acinar tissues and cells in an ex-vivo model. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Experiments were conducted using normal human pancreatic tissues exposed to FAEE. Subcellular fractionation was performed on tissue homogenates and trypsin and cathepsin B activities were estimated in these fractions. Acinar cell injury was evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Cytokine release from exposed acinar cells was evaluated by performing Immuno-fluorescence. Serum was collected from patients with AP within the first 72 h of symptom onset for cytokine estimation using FACS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We observed significant trypsin activation and acinar cell injury in FAEE treated tissue. Cathepsin B was redistributed from lysosomal to zymogen compartment at 30 min of FAEE exposure. IHC results indicated the presence of apoptosis in pancreatic tissue at 1 &amp; 2hrs of FAEE exposure. We also observed a time dependent increase in secretion of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α from FAEE treated acinar tissue. There was also a significant elevation in plasma cytokines in patents with alcohol associated AP within 72 h of symptom onset. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our data suggest that alcohol metabolites can cause acute acinar cell damage and subsequent cytokine release which could eventually culminant in SIRS.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The ISGPF postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) definition using amylase drain concentration is widely used. However, the interest of lipase drain concentration, daily drain output and absolute enzyme daily production (concentration x daily drain volume) have been poorly investigated. Label=“MATERIAL AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:These predictive on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, 5 and 7 were analyzed in a development cohort, and subsequently tested in an independent validation cohort. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 227 patients of the development cohort, 17% developed a biochemical fistula and 34% a POPF (Grade B/C). Strong correlation was found between amylase/lipase drain concentration at all postoperative days (ρ = 0.90; p = 0.001). Amylase and lipase were both significantly higher in patients with a POPF (p &lt; 0.001) presenting an equivalent under the ROC curve area (0.85 vs 0.84; p = 0.466). Combining POD1 and POD3 threefold enzyme cut-off value increased significantly POPF prediction sensibility (97.4% vs 77.8%) and NPV (97.1% vs 86.3%). These results were also confirmed in the validation cohort of 554 patients. Finally, absolute enzyme daily production and daily drain output were significantly higher in patients with a POPF (p &lt; 0.001) but did not add clinical value when compared to drain enzyme concentration. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Lipase is as effective as amylase drain concentration to define POPF. Absolute enzyme daily production or daily drain output do not help to better predict clinically significant POPF occurrence and severity. Lipase and amylase should mainly be used for their negative predictive value to predict the absence of clinically significant POPF and could allow early drain removal and hospital discharge.</p>

<p>Current management of infected pancreatic necrosis is focused on a minimally invasive step-up approach. The step-up approach consists of initial percutaneous or endoscopic drainage of infected pancreatic necrosis, followed, if necessary, by minimally invasive surgical or endoscopic debridement. While there is reduced morbidity and mortality, vascular complications can be life-threatening. Reported vascular complications have been limited to arterial bleeding. Venous bleeding has not been previously reported. We present two cases of portal venous bleeding in patients who underwent treatment for infected pancreatic necrosis with a step-up approach. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and initial management. Moreover, we present two different techniques that can be used to successfully manage venous bleeding in patients who have percutaneous drains in place as part of a step-up approach. These techniques involve tamponading the cavity or drain tract with topical hemostatics and direct embolization of the bleeding vein. These experiences can serve as a guide for managing portal venous bleeding in patients with infected pancreatic necrosis.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To define the association between hospital occupancy rate and postoperative outcomes among patients undergoing hepatopancreatic (HP) resection. Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Previous studies have sought to identify hospital-level characteristics associated with optimal surgical outcomes and decreased expenditures. The present study utilized a novel hospital quality metric coined “occupancy rate” based on publicly available data to assess differences in postoperative outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing HP procedures. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medicare beneficiaries who underwent an elective HP surgery between 2013 and 2017 were identified. Occupancy rate was calculated and hospitals were categorized into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the association between occupancy rate and clinical outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among 33,866 patients, the majority underwent a pancreatic resection (58.5%; n = 19,827), were male (88.4%; n = 7,488), or white (88.4%; n = 29,950); median age was 72 years [interquartile range (IQR): 68-77] and median Charleston Comorbidity Index was 3 (IQR 2-8). Hospitals were categorized into quartiles based on hospital occupancy rate (cutoffs: 48.1%, 59.4%, 68.2%). Most patients underwent an HP operation at a hospital with an above average occupancy rate (n = 20,865, 61.6%), whereas only a small subset of patients had an HP procedure at a low occupancy rate hospital (n = 1,218, 3.6%). On multivariable analysis, low hospital occupancy rate was associated with increased odds of a complication [(OR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.55) and 30-day mortality (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27-1.97). Even among only high-volume HP hospitals, patients operated on at hospitals that had a low occupancy rate were at markedly higher risk of complications (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.97), as well as 30 day morality (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27-3.83). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing an elective HP resection, more than 1 in 4 hospitals performing HP surgeries utilized less than half of their beds on average. There was a monotonic relationship between hospital occupancy rate and the odds of experiencing a complication, as well as 30-day mortality, independent of other hospital level characteristics including procedural volume.</p>

The impact of travel, and possible care fragmentation, on potential benefits of centralized surgery is not well understood. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2016), patients who underwent esophageal, pancreatic, or rectal resections at far HVH meeting volume standards versus local intermediate (IVH) and low-volume (LVH) hospitals were identified. Perioperative outcomes and 5-year OS were compared. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 49,454 patients, 17,544 (34.5%) underwent surgery at far HVH, 11,739 (23.7%) at local IVH, and 20,171 (40.8%) at local LVH. The median (interquartile range) travel distances were 77.1 (51.1-125.4), 13.2 (5.8-27.3), and 7.8 (3.1-15.5) miles to HVH, IVH, and LVH, respectively. By multivariable analysis, LVH was associated with increased 30-day mortality for all resections compared to HVH, but IVH was associated with mortality only for proctectomies [odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.75]. Compared to HVH, both IVH (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.31) and LVH (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.29-1.42) were associated with decreased 5-year OS.

<p>Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal tumor response score (TRS) system to assess regression in pancreatic cancers resected after neoadjuvant therapy. We developed a novel TRS (Royal North Shore [RNS] system) based on estimating the percentage of tumor bed occupied by viable cancer and categorized into 3 tiers: grade 1 (≤10%), grade 2 (11% to 75%), and grade 3 (&gt;75%). We assessed 147 resected carcinomas with this and other TRS systems (College of American Pathologists [CAP], MD Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC], and Evans). The 3-tiered RNS system predicted median survival after surgery for grades 1, 2, and 3 of 54, 23, and 9 months, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The CAP, MDACC, and Evans systems also predicted survival (P&lt;0.05) but less consistently. The median survival for MDACC and CAP grade 0 (complete regression) was less than MDACC grade 1 and CAP grades 1 and 2. There was no difference in survival between CAP grades 2 and 3 (P=0.960), Evans grades 1 and 2a (P=0.395), and Evans grades 2a and 2b (P=0.587). Interobserver concordance was weak for CAP (κ=0.431), moderate for MDACC (κ=0.691), minimal for Evans (κ=0.307), and moderate to strong for RNS (κ=0.632 to 0.84). Of age, sex, size, stage, grade, perineural and vascular invasion, extrapancreatic extension, margin status, and RNS score, only RNS score, vascular invasion, and extrapancreatic extension predicted survival in univariate analysis. Only extrapancreatic extension (P=0.034) and RNS score (P&lt;0.0001) remained significant in multivariate analysis. We conclude that the RNS system is a reproducible and powerful predictor of survival after resection for pancreatic cancers treated with neoadjuvant therapy and should be investigated in larger cohorts.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:CRS/HIPEC is thought to confer a survival advantage for patients with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). However, the impact of nonperitoneal organ resection is not clearly defined. We evaluated the impact of major organ resection (MOR) on postoperative outcomes and overall survival (OS). Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The US HIPEC collaborative database (2000-2017) was reviewed for MPM patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC. MOR was defined as total or partial resection of diaphragm, stomach, spleen, pancreas, small bowel, colon, rectum, kidney, ureter, bladder, and/or uterus. MOR was categorized as 0, 1, or 2+ organs. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 174 patients were identified. Median PCI was 16 (3-39). The distribution of patients with MOR-0, MOR-1, and MOR-2+ was 94, 45, and 35 patients, respectively. MOR-1 and MOR-2+ groups had a higher frequency of any complication compared with MOR-0 (57.8%, 74.3%, and 48.9%, respectively, p = 0.035), but Clavien 3/4 complications were similar. Median length of stay was slightly higher in the MOR-1 and MOR-2+ groups (10 and 11 days) compared with the MOR-0 cohort (9 days, p = 0.005). Incomplete cytoreduction, ASA class 4, and male gender were associated with increased mortality on unadjusted analysis; however, their impact on OS was attenuated on multivariable analysis. MOR was not associated with OS based on these data (MOR-1: HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.59-4.74; MOR-2+ : HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.22-2.69). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:MOR was not associated with an increase in major complications or worse OS in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC for MPM and should be considered, if necessary, to achieve complete cytoreduction for MPM patients.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Compliance with national guidelines on pancreatic cancer management could improve patient outcomes. Early compliance with the Dutch guideline was poor. The aim was to assess compliance with this guideline during six years after publication. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Nationwide guideline compliance was investigated for three subsequent time periods (2012-2013 vs. 2014-2015 vs. 2016-2017) in patients with pancreatic cancer using five quality indicators in the Netherlands Cancer Registry: 1) discussion in multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT), 2) maximum 3-week interval from final MDT to start of treatment, 3) preoperative biliary drainage when bilirubin &gt;250 μmol/L, 4) use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 5) chemotherapy for inoperable disease (non-metastatic and metastatic). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In total, 14 491 patients were included of whom 2290 (15.8%) underwent resection and 4561 (31.5%) received chemotherapy. Most quality indicators did not change over time: overall, 88.8% of patients treated with curative intent were discussed in a MDT, 42.7% were treated with curative intent within the 3-week interval, 62.7% with a resectable head tumor and bilirubin &gt;250 μmol/L underwent preoperative biliary drainage, 57.2% received chemotherapy after resection, and 36.6% with metastatic disease received chemotherapy. Only use of chemotherapy for non-metastatic, non-resected disease improved over time (23.4% vs. 25.6% vs. 29.7%). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Nationwide compliance to five quality indicators for the guideline on pancreatic cancer management showed little to no improvement during six years after publication. Besides critical review of the current quality indicators, these outcomes may suggest that a nationwide implementation program is required to increase compliance to guideline recommendations.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic surgery may result in changes in pancreatic volume and endocrine function. The effects of pancreatic resection for benign neoplasms on pancreatic volume and endocrine function have not been established yet. This study aimed to investigate the long-term results of different pancreatic surgeries for benign pancreatic neoplasms on pancreatic volume and endocrine function. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The medical records of 30 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and 30 patients who underwent left-sided pancreatectomy(LP) for benign pancreatic neoplasms between 2005 and 2012 were reviewed. The changes in pancreatic volume after pancreatic surgery were assessed using multi-detector row computed tomography volumetry. Endocrine pancreatic function was evaluated on the basis of fasting glucose level or oral glucose tolerance test result. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The median follow-up duration was 91.3 months (interquartile range, 75.7-119.1 months). Reduction in pancreatic volume after surgery was more pronounced in patients who underwent PD than in those who underwent LP (median percentage of volume reduction, 23.8% vs 5.1%, p &lt; .001). Multivariable analysis of prognostic factors for endocrine insufficiency showed that PD to be significant factor. (HR 3.87, 95% CI 1.12-14.66, p = .037). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The surgical methods for benign pancreatic neoplasms affect the reduction in pancreatic volume. Furthermore, the methods of pancreatic surgery were associated with the risk of endocrine insufficiency. Further studies with a large number of patients are warranted to evaluate the association between the degree of volume reduction and the development of endocrine insufficiency.</p>

Here, we aimed to evaluate the immunohistochemical and microscopic characteristics of HS in IPMN and IOPN. The prevalence of HS was determined in 168 cases of IPMN, including intestinal type (IPMN-I), gastric type (IPMN-G), and pancreatobiliary type (IPMN-PB), as well as in 11 cases of IOPN. Immunohistochemical staining for laminin and collagen (types I, II, III, IV, and V), as well as Congo red staining were performed in IPMN and IOPN cases containing HS. The prevalence of HS among the IPMN and IOPN specimens was 1.2% (2/168 cases) and 45.5% (5/11 cases), respectively. The prevalence rates of HS in each IPMN subtype were as follows: 2.2% (2/91 cases) in IPMN-G, and 0% in IPMN-PB and IPMN-I. All seven HS cases were positive for collagen I, III, IV, and V but were negative for Congo red staining. Most cases showed negative, focal, or weak expression of laminin and type II collagen.

Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Although a multidisciplinary approach that includes neoadjuvant treatment has been shown to be a better strategy for BRPC than upfront resection, a standard treatment for BRPC has not been established. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A multicenter, single-arm, phase II study was performed. Patients who fulfilled the criteria for BRPC received S-1 (40 mg/m bid) and concurrent radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) before surgery. The primary endpoint was the R0 resection rate. At least 40 patients were required, with a one-sided α = 0.05 and β = 0.05 and expected and threshold values for the primary endpoint of 30% and 10%, respectively. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Fifty-two patients were eligible, and 41 were confirmed to have definitive BRPC by a central review. CRT was completed in 50 (96%) patients and was well tolerated. The rate of grade 3/4 toxicity with CRT was 43%. The R0 resection rate was 52% among the 52 eligible patients and 63% among the 41 patients who were centrally confirmed to have BRPC. Postoperative grade III/IV adverse events according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were observed in 7.5%. Among the 41 centrally confirmed BRPC patients, the 2-year overall survival rate and median overall survival duration were 58% and 30.8 months, respectively.

<p>KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Direct inhibition of KRAS oncoproteins has been a long-standing pursuit in precision oncology, one established shortly after the discovery of RAS mutations in human cancer cells nearly 40 years ago. Recent advances in medicinal chemistry have established inhibitors targeting KRAS(G12C), a mutation found in ∼13% of lung adenocarcinomas and, at a lower frequency, in other cancers. Preclinical studies describing their discovery and mechanism of action, coupled with emerging clinical data from patients treated with these drugs, have sparked a renewed enthusiasm in the study of KRAS and its therapeutic potential. Here, we discuss how these advances are reshaping the fundamental aspects of KRAS oncoprotein biology and the strides being made toward improving patient outcomes in the clinic.</p>

<p>Intracholecystic neoplasms (ICNs) (pyloric gland adenomas and intracholecystic papillary neoplasms, collectively also called intracholecystic papillary/tubular neoplasms) form multifocal, extensive proliferations on the gallbladder mucosa and have a high propensity for invasion (&gt;50%). In this study, 19 examples of a poorly characterized phenomenon, mural papillary mucinous lesions that arise in adenomyomatous nodules and form localized ICNs, were analyzed. Two of these were identified in 1750 consecutive cholecystectomies reviewed specifically for this purpose, placing its incidence at 0.1%. Median age was 68 years. Unlike other gallbladder lesions, these were slightly more common in men (female/male=0.8), and 55% had documented cholelithiasis. All were characterized by a compact multilocular, demarcated, cystic lesion with papillary proliferations and mucinous epithelial lining. The lesions’ architecture, distribution, location, and typical size were suggestive of evolution from an underlying adenomyomatous nodule. All had gastric/endocervical-like mucinous epithelium, but 5 also had a focal intestinal-like epithelium. Cytologic atypia was graded as 1 to 3 and defined as 1A: mucinous, without cytoarchitectural atypia (n=3), 1B: mild (n=7), 2: moderate (n=2), and 3: severe atypia (n=7, 3 of which also had invasive carcinoma, 16%). Background gallbladder mucosal involvement was absent in all but 2 cases, both of which had multifocal papillary mucosal nodules. In conclusion, these cases highlight a distinct clinicopathologic entity, that is, mural ICNs arising in adenomyomatous nodules, which, by essentially sparing the “main” mucosa, not displaying “field-effect/defect” phenomenon, and only rarely (16%) showing carcinomatous transformation, are analogous to pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) remains challenging, especially when serum IgG4 is normal or imaging features are indeterminate. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissues as a diagnostic aid for AIP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted until February 2020. The methodological quality of each study was assessed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist. A random-effects model was used to summarize the diagnostic odds ratio and other measures of accuracy. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The meta-analysis included 20 studies comprising 346 patients with AIP and 590 patients with other pancreatobiliary diseases, including 371 pancreatobiliary malignancies. The summary estimates for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls were as follows: diagnostic odds ratio 38.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 18.70-80.75); sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI, 0.59-0.69); specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.95). The area under the curve was 0.939 for tissue IgG4 in discriminating AIP and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy according to control groups (pancreatobiliary cancer versus other chronic pancreatitis) and sampling site (pancreas versus bile duct/ampulla). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Current data demonstrate that IgG4 immunostaining of pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary tissue has a high specificity but moderate sensitivity for diagnosing AIP. IgG4 immunostaining may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of AIP when AIP is clinically suspected, but a combination of imaging and serology does not provide a conclusive diagnosis.</p>

<p>Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD), or sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare entity characterized by proliferating S100-positive histiocytes. It is most commonly found in lymph nodes with extranodal involvement usually occurring in the head and neck. Pancreatic involvement is extremely rare. The pathology department archives were searched for fine needle aspirations and pancreatic resections showing evidence of RDD. Clinicopathologic features, cytologic smears, cell blocks, immunocytochemical stains and surgical resections were reviewed. Three cases were identified. They were all females, aged 65, 69 and 75, with involvement of the pancreatic tail or head by solid masses of median size 2.3 cm (range 2.1-4.5 cm). Cytologic findings on smears included multiple histiocyte clusters resembling loosely cohesive epithelioid granulomas, singly dispersed histiocytes with moderate to marked nuclear atypia and characteristic emperipolesis. These atypical histiocytes stained positively for CD68, CD163 and S100. Smear background contained variable mixed inflammatory cells, necrotic debris and stromal fragments. The RDD diagnosis was further confirmed on pancreatic resection in two patients and core biopsy in one. The latter patient required three separate procedures before a definitive diagnosis was made. RDD of pancreas is a rare benign inflammatory condition that is diagnostically challenging on cytology. This can cause delays in cytologic diagnosis and/or misdiagnosis. Identification of characteristic cytologic features, primarily histiocytes with emperipolesis, and matching immunocytochemical profile can ensure accurate diagnosis and distinction from mimics.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Integration of palliative care services into the surgical treatment plan is important for holistic patient care. We sought to examine the association between patient race/ethnicity and county-level vulnerability relative to patterns of hospice utilization. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medicare Standard Analytic Files were used to identify patients undergoing lung, esophageal, pancreatic, colon, or rectal cancer surgery between 2013 and 2017. Data were merged with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s social vulnerability index (SVI). Logistic regression was utilized to identify factors associated with overall hospice utilization among deceased individuals. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 54,256 Medicare beneficiaries underwent lung (n = 16,645, 30.7%), esophageal (n = 1427, 2.6%), pancreatic (n = 6183, 11.4%), colon (n = 26,827, 49.4%), or rectal (n = 3174, 5.9%) cancer resection. Median patient age was 76 years (IQR 71-82 years), and 28,887 patients (53.2%) were male; the majority of individuals were White (91.1%, n = 49,443), while a smaller subset was Black or Latino (racial/ethnic minority: n = 4813, 8.9%). Overall, 35,416 (65.3%) patients utilized hospice services prior to death. Median SVI was 52.8 [interquartile range (IQR) 30.3-71.2]. White patients were more likely to utilize hospice care compared with minority patients (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.31, p &lt; 0.001). Unlike White patients, there was reduced odds of hospice utilization (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99) and early hospice initiation (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) as SVI increased among minority patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Patients residing in counties with high social vulnerability were less likely to be enrolled in hospice care at the time of death, as well as be less likely to initiate hospice care early. The effects of increasing social vulnerability on hospice utilization were more profound among minority patients.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To investigate the perioperative and oncologic long-term outcomes of patients with LAPC after surgical resection at a high-volume center for pancreatic surgery. Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The role of surgery in LAPC with arterial involvement is controversial. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed 385 consecutive patients undergoing PAR (n = 195) or PAD (n = 190) of the encased artery for LAPC between January 1, 2003 and April 30, 2019. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:There were 183 total pancreatectomies, 113 partial pancreatoduodenectomies, 79 distal pancreatectomies, and 10 resections for tumor recurrences, including 121 multivisceral resections and 171 venous resections. Forty-three patients (11.4%) had resectable oligometastatic disease. All of the 190 patients undergoing PAD (100%) and 95 of the 195 patients undergoing PAR (48.7%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The R0 (circumferential resection margin negative) resection rate was 28%. The median hospital stay was 15 days (range: 3-236). The median survival after surgery for LAPC was 20.1 months and the overall 5-year survival rate 12.5%. In-hospital mortality was 8.8% for the entire patient cohort (n = 385). With increasing case load and growing expertise, there was a significant reduction of in-hospital mortality to 4.8% (n = 186) after 2013 (P = 0.005). The learning curve of experienced pancreatic surgeons for PAR was 15 such procedures. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our data demonstrate that an arterial surgical approach is effective in LAPC with promising long-term survival. PAD after neoadjuvant treatment is safe.

<p><em>An Aggressive Approach to Locally Confined Pancreatic Cancer: Defining Surgical and Oncologic Outcomes Unique to Pancreatectomy with Celiac Axis Resection (DP-CAR). Annals of surgical oncology 2020 10;()</em></p>
<p>PubMed: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33051739" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33051739</a></p>
<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Modern chemotherapeutics have led to improved systemic disease control for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Surgical strategies such as distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) are increasingly entertained. Herein we review procedure-specific outcomes and assess biologic rationale for DP-CAR. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A prospectively maintained single-institution database of all pancreatectomies was queried for patients undergoing DP-CAR. We excluded all patients for whom complete data were not available and those who were not treated with contemporary multi-agent therapy. Data were supplemented with dedicated chart review and outreach for long-term oncologic outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Fifty-four patients underwent DP-CAR between 2008 and 2018. The median age was 62.7 years. Ninety-eight percent received induction chemotherapy. Arterial reconstruction was performed in 17% and concomitant visceral resection in 30%. The R0 resection rate was 87%. Postoperative complications were common (43%) with chyle leak being the most frequent (17%). Length of stay was 8 days, readmission occurred in one-third, and 90-day mortality was 2%. Disease recurrence occurred in 74% during a median follow up of 17.4 months. Median recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9 and 25 months, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Following modern induction paradigms, DP-CAR can be performed with low mortality, manageable morbidity, and excellent rates of margin-negative resection in high-volume settings. The profile of complications of DP-CAR is distinct from pancreaticoduodenectomy and simple distal pancreatectomy. OS and RFS are similar to those undergoing resection of borderline resectable and resectable disease. Improved systemic disease control will likely lead to increasing utilization of aggressive surgical approaches to LAPC.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:RNA-sequencing-based subtyping of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been reported by multiple research groups, each using different methodologies and patient cohorts. “Classical” and “basal-like” PDAC subtypes are associated with survival differences, with basal-like tumors associated with worse prognosis. We amalgamated various PDAC subtyping tools to evaluate the potential of such tools to be reliable in clinical practice. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Sequencing data for 574 PDAC tumors was obtained from prospective trials and retrospective public databases. Six published PDAC subtyping strategies (Moffitt regression tools, clustering-based Moffitt, Collisson, Bailey, and Karasinska subtypes) were used on each sample, and results were tested for subtype call consistency and association with survival. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Basal-like and classical subtype calls were concordant in 88% of patient samples, and survival outcomes were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between prognostic subtypes. Twelve percent of tumors had subtype-discordant calls across the different methods, showing intermediate survival in univariate and multivariate survival analyses. Transcriptional profiles compatible with that of a hybrid subtype signature were observed for subtype-discordant tumors, in which classical and basal-like genes were concomitantly expressed. Subtype-discordant tumors showed intermediate molecular characteristics, including subtyping gene expression (P &lt; 0.0001) and mutant KRAS allelic imbalance (P &lt; 0.001). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Nearly 1 in 6 patients with PDAC have tumors that fail to reliably fall into the classical or basal-like PDAC subtype categories, based on two regression tools aimed toward clinical practice. Rather, these patient tumors show intermediate prognostic and molecular traits. We propose close consideration of the non-binary nature of PDAC subtypes for future incorporation of subtyping into clinical practice.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harbors mutant KRAS as the most common driver mutation. Studies on mouse models have uncovered the tumorigenic characteristics of the Kras oncogene driving pancreatic carcinogenesis. Similarly, Ewing sarcoma predominantly depends on the occurrence of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene. The expression of EWSR1-FLI1 affects pro-tumorigenic pathways and induces cell transformation. In this study, we investigated whether mutant Kras could be exchanged by another potent oncogene, such as EWSR1-FLI1, to initiate pancreatic cancer development. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We generated two conditional mouse models expressing mutant KrasG12D (KC) or the EWSR1-FLI1 oncogene (E/F) in pancreas cells. Pancreatic tissue was collected from the mice at 4-6 weeks and 11-13 weeks of age as well as from survival cohorts to determine the development of spontaneous acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and neoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were performed to characterize and quantify changes in tissue morphology. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The expression of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein in pancreas cells was confirmed by positive FLI1 immunohistochemistry staining. Notably, the EWSR1-FLI1 expression in pancreas cells resulted in a strong depletion of the acinar cell mass and an extensive lipomatosis. Although the E/F mice exhibited spontaneous ADM formation and a shorter overall survival rate compared to KC mice, no development of neoplastic lesion was observed in aging E/F mice. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The expression of the EWSR1-FLI1 oncogene leads to a strong pancreatic atrophy and lipomatosis. ADM formation indicates that pancreatic acinar cells are susceptible for EWSR1-FLI1-mediated oncogenic transformation to a limited extent. However, the EWSR1-FLI1 oncogene is insufficient to induce pancreatic cancer development.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Cancer-associated fibroblasts have emerged to be highly heterogenous and can play multifaced roles in dictating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression, immunosuppression and therapeutic response, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of stromal heterogeneity between patients and even within a single tumor. We hypothesized that image analysis of fibroblast subpopulations and collagen in PDAC tissues might guide stroma-based patient stratification to predict clinical outcomes and tumor characteristics. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A novel multiplex immunohistochemistry-based image analysis system was established to digitally differentiate fibroblast subpopulations. Using whole-tissue slides from 215 treatment-naïve PDACs, we performed concurrent quantification of principal fibroblast subpopulations and collagen and defined three stroma types: collagen-rich stroma, fibroblast activation protein a (FAP)-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma and a smooth muscle actin (ACTA2)-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma. These stroma types were assessed for the associations with cancer-specific survival by multivariable Cox regression analyses, and with clinicopathological factors including CD8+ cell density. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:FAP-dominant fibroblasts and ACTA2-dominant fibroblasts represented the principal distinct fibroblast subpopulations in tumor stroma. Stroma types were associated with patient survival, SMAD4 status and transcriptome signatures. Compared with FAP-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma, collagen-rich stroma correlated with prolonged survival (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.99), while ACTA2-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma exhibited poorer prognosis (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.06-2.58). FAP-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma was additionally characterized by restricted CD8+-cell infiltrates and intense neutrophil infiltration. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study identified three distinct stroma types differentially associated with survival, immunity and molecular features, thereby underscoring the importance of stromal heterogeneity in subtyping pancreatic cancers and supporting the development of anti-stromal therapies.</p>

<p>Label=“AIM” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Weight loss at diagnosis is common in pancreatic cancer (PC) and can adversely affect overall survival (OS). Little is known about the impact of weight loss occurring during palliative treatment. This study aimed to investigate if early weight loss during chemotherapy for inoperable PC affects OS. Label=“METHOD” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This retrospective study included patients newly-diagnosed with inoperable PC. Consecutive patients initiating first-line palliative chemotherapy between Jan’15 - Jan’19 with data on percentage weight loss at week 4 of treatment (%WLWeek4) were eligible. %WLWeek4 was dichotomised using 5% cut-off. OS was measured from chemotherapy initiation. Survival analysis was performed using Cox regression. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Eligible patients (n = 255); 59.2% with head/neck PC; 52.6% metastatic; received triplet (32.2%), doublet (42.7%) or single-agent (25.1%) palliative chemotherapy. Median %WLWeek4 was -2.05% (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.58 to -1.56); %WLWeek4 was ≥5% in 23.1% patients. Patients on triplet chemotherapy were more likely to develop %WLWeek4 of ≥5% [35.4% (triplet) vs. 19.3% (doublet) vs 14.1% (monotherapy); multivariable Odds Ratio (triplet vs monotherapy) =3.25; 95% CI 1.40-7.56; p-value 0.006]. Median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI 8.54-10.41). Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated shorter OS if %WLWeek4 ≥5% (median OS 7.4 months (95% CI 6.27-10.01) vs. 9.9 months (95% CI 9.20-12.05); HR 2.37 (95% CI 1.64-3.42), P &lt; 0.001); this was independent from other factors (stage, age, number of chemotherapy drugs, ECOG-PS), including response to therapy (supporting that %WLWeek4 impacted on OS regardless of response to therapy). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In advanced PC treated with palliative chemotherapy, a %WLWeek4 ≥5% was more prevalent in patients undergoing triplet chemotherapy, and was associated with shorter OS, regardless of response/progression to therapy. Early identification and intervention of weight loss seems to be key to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Lung non-small cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in the world. Pancreas metastasis from lung cancer is very rare. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) is a useful method to improve the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors and to guide the treatment plan. However, the limited amount of specimen obtained from EUS-FNAB may be a pitfall. Here we present a case of pancreatic metastasis from lung non-small cell carcinoma initially mimicking primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</p>

<p>Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is reported to be a negative prognostic marker in colorectal cancer and is involved in tumorigenesis and progression through several miRNA pathways. In this study, We analyzed its expression in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and explored its relation with survival outcome. 122 patients were enrolled in the study, including 60 cases of GI-NETs, 24 cases of primary hepatic NETs (PHNETs), 16 cases of gallbladder NETs (GBNETs) and 22 cases of pancreatic NETs (pNETs). IHC was performed for DCLK1 on tumor tissue. All patients underwent a baseline visit, histologic determination, and a follow-up for survival. In the 60 cases of GI-NETs, DCLK1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic expression. The positive rates of DCLK1, Syn and CgA were 100% (60/60), 100% (60/60) and 36.7% (22/60), respectively. However, DCLK1 showed negative staining in all of the 62 cases of PHNETs, GBNETs, and pNETs. The mean score of DCLK1, Syn, and CgA were (5.77±2.012), (5.13±2.078) and (2.68±2.797), respectively. DCLK1 was correlated with primary site (P&lt;0.001) and Syn expression (P = 0.045). Additionally, in GI-NETs, we found that DCLK1 expression was associated with worse OS (log-rank = 5.212, P = 0.022). The divergent expression of DCLK1 in NETs suggests different functional roles of DCLK1 in different locations of NET within the digestive system. However, with the limited number of tumor samples, its outcome prediciton still needs further investigation. DCLK1 expression may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of GI-NETs.</p>

<p>Histopathologically scoring the response of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to neoadjuvant treatment can guide the selection of adjuvant therapy and improve prognostic stratification. However, several tumor response scoring (TRS) systems exist, and consensus is lacking as to which system represents best practice. An international consensus meeting on TRS took place in November 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Here, we provide an overview of the outcomes and consensus statements that originated from this meeting. Consensus (≥80% agreement) was reached on a total of seven statements: (1) TRS is important because it provides information about the effect of neoadjuvant treatment that is not provided by other histopathology-based descriptors. (2) TRS for resected PDAC following neoadjuvant therapy should assess residual (viable) tumor burden instead of tumor regression. (3) The CAP scoring system is considered the most adequate scoring system to date because it is based on the presence and amount of residual cancer cells instead of tumor regression. (4) The defining criteria of the categories in the CAP scoring system should be improved by replacing subjective terms including “minimal” or “extensive” with objective criteria to evaluate the extent of viable tumor. (5) The improved, consensus-based system should be validated retrospectively and prospectively. (6) Prospective studies should determine the extent of tissue sampling that is required to ensure adequate assessment of the residual cancer burden, taking into account the heterogeneity of tumor response. (7) In future scientific publications, the extent of tissue sampling should be described in detail in the “Materials and methods” section.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Continuing recalcitrance to therapy cements pancreatic cancer (PC) as the most lethal malignancy, which is set to become the second leading cause of cancer death in our society. The study aim was to investigate the association between DNA damage response (DDR), replication stress, and novel therapeutic response in PC to develop a biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy targeting DDR and replication stress in PC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We interrogated the transcriptome, genome, proteome, and functional characteristics of 61 novel PC patient-derived cell lines to define novel therapeutic strategies targeting DDR and replication stress. Validation was done in patient-derived xenografts and human PC organoids. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Patient-derived cell lines faithfully recapitulate the epithelial component of pancreatic tumors, including previously described molecular subtypes. Biomarkers of DDR deficiency, including a novel signature of homologous recombination deficiency, cosegregates with response to platinum (P &lt; .001) and PARP inhibitor therapy (P &lt; .001) in vitro and in vivo. We generated a novel signature of replication stress that predicts response to ATR (P &lt; .018) and WEE1 inhibitor (P &lt; .029) treatment in both cell lines and human PC organoids. Replication stress was enriched in the squamous subtype of PC (P &lt; .001) but was not associated with DDR deficiency. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Replication stress and DDR deficiency are independent of each other, creating opportunities for therapy in DDR-proficient PC and after platinum therapy.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Diagnosing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia without invasion, traditionally referred to as carcinoma in situ (CIS), is essential for improving prognosis. We examined the imaging findings of patients with and without CIS to identify significant aspects for the diagnosis of CIS. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Forty-six patients strongly suspected of early pancreatic cancer without nodule on imaging (CIS group, n = 27; non-malignant group, n = 19) were retrospectively evaluated according to ten factors of computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using hierarchical cluster and univariate analyses. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Two clusters were formed by hierarchical cluster analysis. One cluster consisted of 83.3% CIS cases with similar image findings such as focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy (FPPA) on CT/MRI, main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas on EUS, and MPD stricture with upstream MPD dilation on ERCP. On univariate analysis, the CIS and non-malignant groups had FPPA on CT/MRI in 15 (55.6%) and 3 (15.8%) cases (p = 0.013), and MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas on EUS in 20 (74.1%) and 4 (21.1%) cases (p = 0.001), respectively. MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas was observed in 80% (12/15) of CIS cases with FPPA on CT/MRI and correlated with FPPA. Moreover, FPPA and MPD stricture surrounded by hypoechoic areas had histopathologically observed fibrosis or fat replacement due to pancreatic parenchymal atrophy.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:We recently reported prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4), a potential tumor suppressor protein restrains epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties and promotes mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) in invasive cancer cells by repressing Twist-1 promoter activity. Here, we demonstrate that genetic as well as pharmacological modulation of Par-4 by NGD16 (a small molecule antimetastatic agent), limits EMT-induced chemoresistance in aggressive cancer cells by suppressing MDM-2, a downstream effector of Twist-1. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Matrigel invasion assay, gelatin degradation assay, cell scattering assay, MTT assay and colony formation assay were used to study the proliferation and migration abilities of invasive cancer cells. Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation analysis were utilized for determining protein expression and protein-protein interaction. 4T1 aggressive mouse carcinoma model was employed to evaluate tumor growth and lung metastasis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Treatment of gemcitabine (nucleoside analogue anticancer agent) to pancreatic cancer (Panc-1, MiaPaca-2) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells amplified MDM-2 expression along with increase in EMT properties. Conversely, NGD16 boosted expression of tumor suppressor Par-4 and inhibited invasion and migration abilities of these cells. Moreover, induction of Par-4 effectively diminished MDM-2 along with pro-EMT markers, whereas, augmented the expression of epithelial markers. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated silencing of Par-4 divulged that NGD16 exerts its EMT inhibitory effects in a Par-4-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Par-4 activation provokes p53 by disrupting MDM-2-p53 interaction, which restored epithelial characteristics in cancer cells. Additionally, partial knockdown of MDM-2 through siRNA pronounced the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of NGD16. Finally, NGD16 efficiently inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse mammary carcinoma model without showing any undesirable effects. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our findings unveil Par-4 as a key therapeutic target and NGD16 (the pharmacological modulator of Par-4) are potential tools to suppress EMT and associated chemoresistance, which could be exploited clinically for the treatment of aggressive cancers.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. There is an unmet need to develop strategies to detect PaCa at an early, operable stage and prevent its progression. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic PaCa precursors that comprise nearly 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally via cross-sectional imaging. Since IPMNs can progress from low- and moderate-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasion, the study of these lesions offers a prime opportunity to develop early detection and prevention strategies. Organoids are an ideal preclinical platform to study IPMNs, and the objective of the current investigation was to establish a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from IPMNs. IPMN tumors and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were successfully harvested from 15 patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic surgical resection at Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute (Tampa, FL) between May of 2017 and March of 2019. Organoid cultures were also generated from cryopreserved tissues. Organoid count and size were determined over time by both Image-Pro Premier 3D Version 9.1 digital platform and Matlab application of a Circular Hough Transform algorithm, and histologic and genomic characterization of a subset of the organoids was performed using immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing, respectively. The success rates for organoid generation from IPMN tumor and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were 81% and 87%, respectively. IPMN organoids derived from different epithelial subtypes showed different morphologies in vitro, and organoids recapitulated histologic and genomic characteristics of the parental IPMN tumor. In summary, this preclinical model has the potential to provide new opportunities to unveil mechanisms of IPMN progression to invasion and to shed insight into novel biomarkers for early detection and targets for chemoprevention.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Despite substantial morbidity and mortality associated with acute pancreatitis (AP), only one small randomized controlled drug trial (RCT) is available in the past few decades from the United States. Hence, we conducted a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of pentoxifylline in AP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 9 doses of oral pentoxifylline 400 mg or placebo tablet, three times daily, was administered within 72 h of diagnosis, using randomization blocks by pharmacy. Primary outcome was a composite outcome including any of the following: death, peripancreatic and/or pancreatic necrosis, infected pancreatic necrosis, persistent organ failure, persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome, hospital stay longer than 4 days, need for intensive care, and need for intervention for necrosis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Between July 7, 2015, and April 4, 2017, we identified 685 patients with AP, 233 met eligibility criteria and 176 were approached for the study. Of these, 91 (51.7%) declined and finally 45 in pentoxifylline group and 38 in placebo group (83 total) were compared. There were no significant differences in primary outcome (27 [60.0%] vs 15 [39.5%]; P = .06). Pentoxifylline group was not associated with any benefit, but withlonger stay (42% vs. 21%; P = .04) and higher readmission rates (16 %vs 3%; P = .047). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We could not demonstrate superiority of pentoxifylline over placebo. Smaller sample size and inclusion of all types of severity might be the reasons for lack of efficacy.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is considered a potential approach to improve survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA). The objective of this study was to identify the clinical implications of washing peritoneal cytology (CY) status after NAT. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Between 2005 and 2016, 151 consecutive patients with resectable (R)/borderline resectable (BR) PA underwent NAT with intention of subsequent resection at our institution. Of them, 13 and 123 patients underwent pancreatectomies with positive (CY+) and negative (CY-) cytology, respectively, while the remaining 15 patients did not undergo resection due to gross metastases at laparotomy. The clinicopathological factors influencing overall survival were clarified by the uni- and multivariate analyses. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were markedly worse in patients who underwent resection with CY+, compared with those who were CY- (median OS, 14.8 m vs 30.8 m, p = 0.026, and median DFS 6.0 m vs 15.1 m, p = 0.008). According to the resectability by NCCN guidelines, CY+ indicates worse prognosis than CY- in R-PA patients (mOS: 30.1 m vs 71.1 m: p = 0.080). Similarly, in BR-PA patients, CY+ showed the significantly worse prognosis than CY- (mOS: 13.8 m vs 24.5 m: p = 0.048), which prognosis is comparable with patients who did not undergo resection. The multivariate analysis revealed that resectability, CY status and the induction of adjuvant therapy were significant predictors of postoperative OS (p = 0.007: Hazard ratio 2.264, 0.040:2.094 and 0.002:3.246, respectively). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:CY+ is a significant predictor of poorer prognosis in PA patients after NAT.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND”:The pancreas is small and irregular in shape in people with type 2 diabetes. If these abnormalities are caused by the disease state itself rather than being a predisposing factor, remission of type 2 diabetes should restore normal pancreas morphology. The objective of this study was to determine whether changes in pancreas volume and shape occurred during 2 years of remission. Label=“METHODS”:For this post-hoc analysis, we included a subset of adult participants of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT), who had type 2 diabetes and were randomly assigned to a weight management intervention or routine diabetes management. Intervention group participants were categorised as responders (HbA1c &lt;6·5% [48 mmol/mol] and fasting blood glucose &lt;7·0 mmol/L, off all anti-diabetes medication) and non-responders, who were classified as remaining diabetic. Data on pancreas volume and irregularity of pancreas border at baseline, 5 months, 12 months, and 24 months after intervention were compared between responders and non-responders; additional comparisons were made between control group participants with type 2 diabetes and a non-diabetic comparator (NDC) group, who were matched to the intervention group by age, sex, and post-weight-loss weight, to determine the extent of any normalisation. We used a mixed-effects regression model based on repeated measures ANOVA with correction for potential confounding. Magnetic resonance techniques were employed to quantify pancreas volume, the irregularity of the pancreas borders, and intrapancreatic fat content. β-cell function and biomarkers of tissue growth were also measured. Label=“FINDINGS”:Between July 25, 2015, and Aug 5, 2016, 90 participants with type 2 diabetes in the DiRECT subset were randomly assigned to intervention (n=64) or control (n=26) and were assessed at baseline; a further 25 non-diabetic participants were enrolled into the NDC group. At baseline, mean pancreas volume was 61·7 cm3 (SD 16·0) in all participants with type 2 diabetes and 79·8 cm3 (14·3) in the NDC group (p&lt;0·0001). At 24 months, pancreas volume had increased by 9·4 cm3 (95% CI 6·1 to 12·8) in responders compared with 6·4 cm3 (2·5 to 10·3) in non-responders (p=0·0008). Pancreas borders at baseline were more irregular in participants with type 2 diabetes than in the NDC group (fractal dimension 1·138 [SD 0·027] vs 1·097 [0·025]; p&lt;0·0001) and had normalised by 24 months in responders only (1·099 [0·028]). Intrapancreatic fat declined by 1·02 percentage points (95% CI 0·53 to 1·51) in 32 responders and 0·51% (-0·17 to 1·19) in 13 non-responders (p=0·23).

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are non-invasive precursor lesions that can progress to invasive pancreatic cancer and are classified as low-grade or high-grade based on the morphology of the neoplastic epithelium. We aimed to compare genetic alterations in low-grade and high-grade regions of the same IPMN in order to identify molecular alterations underlying neoplastic progression. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We performed multiregion whole exome sequencing on tissue samples from 17 IPMNs with both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia (76 IPMN regions, including 49 from low-grade dysplasia and 27 from high-grade dysplasia). We reconstructed the phylogeny for each case, and we assessed mutations in a novel driver gene in an independent cohort of 63 IPMN cyst fluid samples. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Our multiregion whole exome sequencing identified KLF4, a previously unreported genetic driver of IPMN tumorigenesis, with hotspot mutations in one of two codons identified in &gt;50% of the analyzed IPMNs. Mutations in KLF4 were significantly more prevalent in low-grade regions in our sequenced cases. Phylogenetic analyses of whole exome sequencing data demonstrated diverse patterns of IPMN initiation and progression. Hotspot mutations in KLF4 were also identified in an independent cohort of IPMN cyst fluid samples, again with a significantly higher prevalence in low-grade IPMNs. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Hotspot mutations in KLF4 occur at high prevalence in IPMNs. Unique among pancreatic driver genes, KLF4 mutations are enriched in low-grade IPMNs. These data highlight distinct molecular features of low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and suggest diverse pathways to high-grade dysplasia via the IPMN pathway.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is challenging. Sonographic and cross-sectional imaging findings of AIP closely mimic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and techniques for tissue sampling of AIP are suboptimal. These limitations often result in delayed or failed diagnosis, which negatively impact patient management and outcomes. This study aimed to create an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained to differentiate AIP from PDAC, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal pancreas (NP), with sufficient performance to analyse EUS video in real time. Label=“DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A database of still image and video data obtained from EUS examinations of cases of AIP, PDAC, CP and NP was used to develop a CNN. Occlusion heatmap analysis was used to identify sonographic features the CNN valued when differentiating AIP from PDAC. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:From 583 patients (146 AIP, 292 PDAC, 72 CP and 73 NP), a total of 1 174 461 unique EUS images were extracted. For video data, the CNN processed 955 EUS frames per second and was: 99% sensitive, 98% specific for distinguishing AIP from NP; 94% sensitive, 71% specific for distinguishing AIP from CP; 90% sensitive, 93% specific for distinguishing AIP from PDAC; and 90% sensitive, 85% specific for distinguishing AIP from all studied conditions (ie, PDAC, CP and NP). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The developed EUS-CNN model accurately differentiated AIP from PDAC and benign pancreatic conditions, thereby offering the capability of earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Use of this model offers the potential for more timely and appropriate patient care and improved outcome.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:To compare the clinical characteristics and overall survival (OS) of germline mutation carriers in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes and noncarriers with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Germline DNA from 3,078 patients with PDAC enrolled in a prospective registry at Mayo Clinic between 2000 and 2017 was analyzed for mutations in 37 cancer predisposition genes. Characteristics and OS of patients with mutations in eight genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D) involved in HRR were compared with patients testing negative for mutations in all 37 genes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The 175 HRR mutation carriers and 2,730 noncarriers in the study had a median duration of follow-up of 9.9 years. HRR mutation carriers were younger (median age at diagnosis: 63 vs. 66 years, P &lt; 0.001) and more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis (46% vs. 36%, P = 0.004). In a multivariable model adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, and tumor staging, patients with germline HRR mutations had a significantly longer OS compared with noncarriers [HR, 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70-0.97; P = 0.02]. Further gene-level analysis demonstrated that germline ATM mutation carriers had longer OS compared with patients without germline mutations in any of the 37 genes (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.94; P = 0.01). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This study demonstrates that germline mutation carrier status in PDAC is associated with longer OS compared with noncarriers. Further research into tumor biology and response to platinum-based chemotherapy in germline mutation carriers with PDAC are needed to better understand the association with longer OS.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a serious complication after gastric cancer surgery. The current study aimed to investigate the significance of the anatomic location of the pancreas as a predictor for POPF in both laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and open gastrectomy (OG). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In total, 233 patients with gastric cancer were assessed retrospectively. We measured the maximum vertical (P-L height; PLH) and horizontal length (P-L depth; PLD) between the upper border of pancreas and the root of left gastric artery on a preoperative CT in the sagittal direction. The maximum length of the vertical line between the surface of the pancreas and the aorta (P-A length), previously reported as prognostic factor of POPF, was also measured. We investigated the correlations between these parameters and the incidence of POPF in LG and OG groups. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Among the patients in this study, 118 underwent OG and 115 underwent LG. In LG, the median PLH and P-A length in patients with POPF were significantly longer compared with those without POPF (p = 0.026, 0.034, respectively), but not in OG. There was no significant difference in the median PLD between the patients with or without POPF in both LG and OG. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that PLH (odds ratio [OR] 4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-11.3, P = 0.004) and P-A length (OR 4.06, 95%CI 1.05-15.7, P = 0.042] were independent factors for predicting POPF in LG. However, intraoperative blood loss (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.05-6.18, P = 0.038) was extracted as an independent factor in OG. The median amylase level in the drained fluid (D-Amy) were significantly higher in patients with high PLH(≥12.4 mm) or high P-A length (≥45 mm) compared with those with low PLH or low P-A length in LG. However, there were no differences in the D-Amy levels by PLH or P-A length in OG patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The anatomic location of the pancreas is a specific and independent predictor of POPF in LG but not in OG. PLH is a simple parameter that can evaluate the anatomic position of the pancreas, and it may be useful for preventing POPF after LG.</p>

<p><em>TRPS1: a highly sensitive and specific marker for breast carcinoma, especially for triple-negative breast cancer. Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc 2020 10;()</em></p>
<p>PubMed: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33011748" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33011748</a></p>
<p>Currently there is no highly specific and sensitive marker to identify breast cancer-the most common malignancy in women. Breast cancer can be categorized as estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive luminal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) types based on the expression of ER, PR, and HER2. Although GATA3 is the most widely used tumor marker at present to determine the breast origin, which has been shown to be an excellent marker for ER-positive and low-grade breast cancer, but it does not work well for TNBC with sensitivity as low as &lt;20% in metaplastic breast carcinoma. In the current study, through TCGA data mining we identified trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 (TRPS1) as a specific gene for breast carcinoma across 31 solid tumor types. Moreover, high mRNA level of TRPS1 was found in all four subtypes of breast carcinoma including ER/PR-positive luminal A and B types, HER2-positive type, and basal-type/TNBC. We then analyzed TRPS1 expression in 479 cases of various types of breast cancer using immunochemistry staining, and found that TRPS1 and GATA3 had comparable positive expression in ER-positive (98% vs. 95%) and HER2-positive (87% vs. 88%) breast carcinomas. However, TRPS1 which was highly expressed in TNBC, was significantly higher than GATA3 expression in metaplastic (86% vs. 21%) and nonmetaplastic (86% vs. 51%) TNBC. In addition, TRPS1 expression was evaluated in 1234 cases of solid tumor from different organs. In contrast to the high expression of GATA3 in urothelial carcinoma, TRPS1 showed no or little expression in urothelial carcinomas or in other tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colon and gastric adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. These findings suggest that TRPS1 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for breast carcinoma and can be used as a great diagnostic tool, especially for TNBC.</p>

<p><em>Kras mutation rate precisely orchestrates ductal derived pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and pancreatic cancer. Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology 2020 10;()</em></p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite the high prevalence of Kras mutations in pancreatic cancer patients, murine models expressing the oncogenic mutant Kras (Krasmut) in mature pancreatic cells develop PDAC at a low frequency. Independent of cell of origin, a second genetic hit (loss of tumor suppressor TP53 or PTEN) is important for development of PDAC in mice. We hypothesized ectopic expression and elevated levels of oncogenic mutant Kras would promote PanIN arising in pancreatic ducts. To test our hypothesis, the significance of elevating levels of K-Ras and Ras activity has been explored by expression of a CAG driven LGSL-KrasG12V allele (cKras) in pancreatic ducts, which promotes ectopic Kras expression. We predicted expression of cKras in pancreatic ducts would generate neoplasia and PDAC. To test our hypothesis, we employed tamoxifen dependent CreERT2 mediated recombination. Hnf1b:CreERT2;KrasG12V (cKrasHnf1b/+) mice received 1 (Low), 5 (Mod) or 10 (High) mg per 20 g body weight to recombine cKras in low (cKrasLow), moderate (cKrasMod), and high (cKrasHigh) percentages of pancreatic ducts. Our histologic analysis revealed poorly differentiated aggressive tumors in cKrasHigh mice. cKrasMod mice had grades of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN), recapitulating early and advanced PanIN observed in human PDAC. Proteomics analysis revealed significant differences in PTEN/AKT and MAPK pathways between wild type, cKrasLow, cKrasMod, and cKrasHigh mice. In conclusion, in this study, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in pancreatic ducts generates early and late PanIN as well as PDAC. This Ras rheostat model provides evidence that AKT signaling is an important early driver of invasive ductal derived PDAC.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The impact of glycemic status and insulin resistance on the risk of pancreatic cancer in the nondiabetic population remains uncertain. We aimed to examine the association of glycemic status and insulin resistance with pancreatic cancer mortality in individuals with and without diabetes. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This is a cohort study of 572,021 Korean adults without cancer at baseline, who participated in repeat screening examinations which included fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and insulin, and were followed for a median of 8.4 years (interquartile range, 5.3 -13.2 years). Vital status and pancreatic cancer mortality were ascertained through linkage to national death records. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:During 5,211,294 person-years of follow-up, 260 deaths from pancreatic cancer were identified, with a mortality rate of 5.0 per 10 person-years. In the overall population, the risk of pancreatic cancer mortality increased with increasing levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c in a dose-response manner, and this association was observed even in individuals without diabetes. In nondiabetic individuals without previously diagnosed or screen-detected diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia were positively associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality. Specifically, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for pancreatic cancer mortality comparing the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.49 (1.08-2.05), and the corresponding hazard ratio comparing the insulin ≥75th percentile to the &lt;75th percentile was 1.43 (1.05-1.95). These associations remained significant when introducing changes in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and other confounders during follow-up as time-varying covariates. Label=“DISCUSSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Glycemic status, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, even in individuals without diabetes, were independently associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer mortality.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The impact on clinical practice of the international guidelines including the Sendai Guidelines (SG06) and Fukuoka Guidelines (FG12) on the management of cystic lesions of the pancreas (CLP) has not been well-studied. The primary aim was to examine the changing trends and outcomes in the surgical management of CLP in our institution over time and to determine the impact of these guidelines on our institution practice. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:462 patients with surgically-treated CLP were retrospectively reviewed and classified under the 2 guidelines. The cohort was divided into 3 time periods: 1998-2006, 2007-2012 and 2013 to 2018. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Comparison across the 3 time periods demonstrated significantly increasing frequency of older patients, asymptomatic CLP, male gender, smaller tumor size, elevated Ca 19-9, use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) prior to surgery. There was also significantly increasing frequency of adherence to the international guidelines as evidenced by the increasing proportion of HRSG06 and HRFG12 CLP with a corresponding lower proportion of LRSG06 and LRFG12 being resected. This resulted in a significantly higher proportion of resected CLP whereby the final pathology confirmed that a surgery was actually indicated. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Over time, there was increasing adherence to the international guidelines for the selection of patients for surgical resection as evidenced by the significantly increasing proportion of HRSG06 and HRFG06 CLPs undergoing surgery. This was associated with a significantly higher proportion of patients with a definitive indication for surgery. These suggested that over time, there was a continuous improvement in our selection of appropriate CLP for surgical treatment.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:This study assesses how the volume of pancreatic-adjacent operations (PAO) impacts the outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:It is well-established that regionalization benefits outcomes after PD. However, due to a multitude of factors, including geographic, financial and personal, not all patients receive their care at high-volume pancreas surgery centers. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The National Cancer Database was queried for pancreatic cancer patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Hospital volume was calculated for PD and PAO (defined as gastric, hepatic, complex biliary, or pancreatic operations other than PD) and dichotomized as low- and high-volume centers based on the median. Three study cohort were created: low-volume hospitals (LVH) for both PD and PAO, mixed-volume hospital (MVH) with low-volume PD but high-volume PAO, and high-volume PD hospital (HVH). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In total, 24,572 patients were identified, with 41.5%, 7.2%, and 51.3% patients treated at LVH, MVH, and HVH, respectively. 30-day mortality for PD was 5.6% in LVH, 3.2% in MVH, and 2.5% in HVH. On multivariable analyses, LVH was predictive for higher 30-day mortality compared to HVH (OR, 2.068; 95% CI, 1.770-2.418; p &lt; 0.0001). However, patients at MVH demonstrated similar 30-day mortality to patients treated at HVH (OR, 1.258; 95% CI, 0.942-1.680; p = 0.1203). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:PD outcomes at low-volume centers that have experience with complex cancer operations near the pancreas are similar to PD outcomes at hospitals with high PD volume. MVH provide a model for PD outcomes to improve quality and access for patients who cannot, or choose not to, receive their care at high-volume centers.</p>

Label=“SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The external validity of multicenter randomized trials in cancer treatment has been criticized for suboptimal non-representative inclusion. In trials, it is unclear how outcomes compare between randomized and non-randomized patients. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:At eight of 16 participant centers, this multicenter observational study identified validation patients, who had been eligible but not randomized during recruitment for the PREOPANC trial. We assessed the accrual proportion, investigated their most common reasons for not participating in the trial, and compared resection rates, radical (R0) resection rates and overall survival (OS) between the validation patients and PREOPANC patients, who had been randomized in the trial to immediate surgery. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In total, 455 patients had been eligible during the recruitment period, 151 of whom (33%) had been randomized. Fifty-five percent of the 304 validation patients had refused to participate. Median OS in the validation group was 15.2 months, against 15.5 months in the PREOPANC group (p = 1.00). The respective resection rates (76% vs. 73%) and R0 resection rates (51% vs. 46%) did not differ between the groups. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The PREOPANC trial included a reasonable percentage of 33% of eligible patients.

<p>Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) are the second most common epithelial tumors of the pancreas. Despite improvements in prognostic grading and staging systems, it remains a challenge to predict the clinical behavior of panNENs and the response to specific therapies given the high degree of heterogeneity of these tumors. Most panNENs are nonfunctional and present as advanced disease. However, systemic therapies provide modest benefits.

Despite improvements in prognostic grading and staging systems, it remains a challenge to predict the clinical behavior of panNENs and the response to specific therapies given the high degree of heterogeneity of these tumors. Most panNENs are nonfunctional and present as advanced disease. However, systemic therapies provide modest benefits.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) is frequently associated with positive surgical margins and a poor prognosis because the tumor is in contact with major vessels. This study evaluated the relationship between the margin-negative (R0) resection rate and findings indicating peripancreatic vascular invasion on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) imaging after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) in patients with BRPC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Twenty-nine BRPC patients who underwent laparotomy after neoadjuvant S-1 with concurrent radiotherapy were studied retrospectively. Peripancreatic major vessel invasion was evaluated based on the length of tumor-vessel contact on MDCT. The R0 resection rates were compared between the progression of vascular invasion (PVI) group and the non-progression of vascular invasion (NVI) group. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:There were 3 patients with partial responses (10%), 25 with stable disease (86%), and 1 with progressive disease (3%) according to the RECISTv1.1 criteria. Regarding vascular invasion, 9 patients (31%) were classified as having PVI, and 20 patients (69%) were classified as having NVI. Of the 29 patients, 27 (93%) received an R0 resection, and all the PVI patients received an R0 resection (9/9; R0 resection rate = 100%) while 90% (18/20) of the NVI patients underwent an R0 resection. The exact 95% confidence interval of risk difference between those R0 resection rates was - 10.0% [- 31.7-20.4%]. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Patients with BRPC after NACRT achieved high R0 resection rates regardless of the vascular invasion status. BRPC patients can undergo R0 resections unless progressive disease is observed after NACRT. Label=“TRIAL REGISTRATION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:UMIN-CTR, UMIN000009172 .

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a grim disease with high mortality rates. Increased macrophage influx in PDAC is a common hallmark and associated with poor prognosis. Macrophages have high cellular plasticity, which can differentiate into both anti- and pro-tumorigenic properties. Here, we investigated how naïve (M0) macrophages differ from other macrophages in their anti-tumorigenic activities. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In vitro BrdU proliferation and Annexin V cell death analyses were performed on PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 PDAC cell lines exposed to conditioned medium of different macrophage subsets. Macrophage secreted factors were measured by transcript analysis and ELISA. Therapeutic antibodies were used to functionally establish the impact of the identified cytokine on PDAC proliferation. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Proliferation and cell death assays revealed that only M0 macrophages harbor anti-tumorigenic activities and that M1, M2, and TAMs do not. mRNA analysis and ELISA results suggested TNF-α as a potential candidate to mediate M0 macrophage induced cell death. To demonstrate the importance of TNF-α in M0 macrophage-induced cell death, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell-lines were exposed to M0 macrophage conditioned medium in the presence of the TNF-α inhibitor Infliximab, which effectively diminished the anti-tumor activities of M0 macrophages. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Newly tumor-infiltrated naive M0 macrophages exert anti-tumorigenic activities via TNF-α secretion. Their subsequent differentiation into either M1, M2, or TAM subsets reduces TNF-α levels, thereby abolishing their cytotoxic activity on PDAC cells. These data suggest that reestablishing TNF-α secretion in differentiated macrophages might yield a therapeutic benefit.</p>

Label=“RESULTS”:The risk of mortality increased in the order of Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le(a-b-) [reference; hazard ratio (HR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.03-1.57; P = 0.02; and HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.31-2.09; P &lt; 0.001] after adjusting for other predictors. Among patients with serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 lower than 37 U/mL, the association seemed more apparent (reference; HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.77-2.29; P = 0.22; and HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.10-4.02; P &lt; 0.02). Label=“CONCLUSIONS”:The risk of mortality increased in the order of Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le(a-b-). The difference in prognosis according to the Lewis antigen phenotype was more pronounced in the low CA 19-9 group, which suggests that the Lewis antigen phenotype works as a biomarker predicting the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer with undetectable CA 19-9 level.</p>

<p>Somatic LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition has been detected in early embryos, adult brains, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and many cancers, including epithelial GI tumors. We previously found numerous somatic L1 insertions in paired normal and GI cancerous tissues. Here, using a modified method of single-cell analysis for somatic L1 insertions, we studied adenocarcinomas of colon, pancreas, and stomach, and found a variable number of somatic L1 insertions in tumors of the same type from patient to patient. We detected no somatic L1 insertions in single cells of 5 of 10 tumors studied. In three tumors, aneuploid cells were detected by FACS. In one pancreatic tumor, there were many more L1 insertions in aneuploid than in euploid tumor cells. In one gastric cancer, both aneuploid and euploid cells contained large numbers of likely clonal insertions. However, in a second gastric cancer with aneuploid cells, no somatic L1 insertions were found. We suggest that when the cellular environment is favorable to retrotransposition, aneuploidy predisposes tumor cells to L1 insertions, and retrotransposition may occur at the transition from euploidy to aneuploidy. Seventeen percent of insertions were also present in normal cells, similar to findings in genomic DNA from normal tissues of GI tumor patients. We provide evidence that: 1) The number of L1 insertions in tumors of the same type is highly variable, 2) most somatic L1 insertions in GI cancer tissues are absent from normal tissues, and 3) under certain conditions, somatic L1 retrotransposition exhibits a propensity for occurring in aneuploid cells., Somatic LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition has been detected in early embryos, adult brains, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and many cancers, including epithelial GI tumors.

<p>Colorectal cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and esophageal cancer are leading causes of cancer related deaths worldwide. A fundamental trait of virtually all gastrointestinal cancers is genomic and epigenomic DNA alterations. Cancer cells acquire genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive the initiation and progression of the cancers by altering the molecular and cell biological processes of the cells. These alterations, as well as other host and microenvironment factors, ultimately mediate the clinical behavior of the pre-cancers and cancers and can be used as biomarkers for cancer risk determination, early detection of cancer and pre-cancer, determination of the prognosis of cancer and prediction of the response to therapy. Epigenetic alterations have emerged as one of most robust classes of biomarkers and are the basis for a growing number of clinical tests for cancer screening and surveillance.</p>

<p>Neutral Cholesterol Ester Hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) is an enzyme involved in ether lipid metabolism, and the NCEH1 gene is overexpressed in a variety of tumors. However, its role in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. Therefore, we compared the gene transcription data of healthy and pancreatic cancer tissues using the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. R software (v3.6.1) was used for the differential, clinicopathological correlation, and survival analyses. We found that NCEH1 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with that in healthy tissues (P = 1.732 e-50), and that its expression level was related to lymph node metastasis. High NCEH1 expression was associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.002). Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we determined that NCEH1 is an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis identified that NCEH1 overexpression is prominent in cell-cell adhesion junctions, pancreatic cancer, cancer-associated pathways, prostate cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia. In contrast, low NCEH1 expression correlated to high oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude that NCEH1 may be a prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Hereditary pancreatitis is a rare form of recurrent acute pancreatitis that typically has an onset in early adulthood. We report a rare case of hereditary pancreatitis in an individual with a serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) mutation. Histologically the pancreas showed features of chronic pancreatitis with variable fibrosis, acinar destruction, and prominent inspissated secretions within the pancreatic ducts. Additionally, focal areas of low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) were present. Although the histopathology of common gene mutations resulting in hereditary pancreatitis have been well described, the histopathology of pancreatitis secondary to SPINK1 mutation has been described in only one previous study.</p>

<p>The SWItch Sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex is a large, multi-subunit ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex that acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating transcription. Mutations of SWI/SNF subunits have been described in relation to developmental disorders, hereditary SWI/SNF deficiency syndromes, as well as malignancies. In this review we summarize the current literature in regards to SWI/SNF-deficient tumors of the luminal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and pancreas. As a group they range from moderately to undifferentiated tumors composed of monotonous anaplastic cells, prominent macronucleoli and a variable rhabdoid cell component. Deficiency of a SWI/SNF subunit is typified by complete loss of nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry for respective subunit.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Streptozocin (STZ) is used for treating both pancreatic (PanNET) and gastrointestinal (GI-NET) neuroendocrine tumors but its therapeutic efficacy is relatively low in GI-NETs. Therefore, it has become pivotal to select GI-NET patients who could benefit from STZ treatment. STZ is transported via the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) into the cells and the loss of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) also increases its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, GLUT2 high and MGMT low status could be the surrogate markers of STZ. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:In this study, we examined the MGMT and GLUT2 status in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN). We studied 84 NEN cases: 33 foregut and 37 hindgut GI-NETs and 14 gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In GI-NETs, MGMT scores of ≥2 and ≥ 3 were 77% (54/70) and 56% (39/70), respectively, and GLUT2 scores of ≥4 and ≥ 6 were 30% (21/70) and 4.3% (3/70), respectively. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed that MGMT promoter methylation was detected only in 2/14 GI-NECs but none of the included GI-NETs. GLUT2 (GLUT2 score) and MGMT immunoreactivity (MGMT and H-scores) were both significantly correlated with Ki-67 labeling index (GLUT2 score: P = 0.0045, ρ = - 0.4570; MGMT score: P = 0.0064, ρ = - 0.4399; H-score: P = 0.0110, ρ = - 0.4135) and MGMT immunoreactivity were significantly correlated with GLUT2 immunoreactivity (MGMT score: P = 0.0198; H-score, P = 0.0004, ρ = 0.5483) in hindgut NETs, but not in foregut NETs. However, discrepancies from the above correlation between GLUT2 and MGMT immunoreactivity were detected in several GI-NET cases which could be potential candidates for STZ therapy. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The evaluation of MGMT and GLUT2 status could provide an important information in planning STZ therapy in GI-NET patients.</p>

<p><em>Optimization of Immunophenotypic Panel to Differentiate Upper From Lower Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinomas: Analysis of New and Traditional Markers. Applied immunohistochemistry &amp; molecular morphology : AIMM ;29(1)</em></p>

<p>Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus (EAC), stomach [gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC)], and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) frequently show similar morphology because upper gastrointestinal tumors (GITs) usually evolve from pathologies involving intestinal metaplasia. Upper and lower GIT may also show overlapping immunophenotypes when using the traditional CK7, CK20, and CDX2 panel, which in patients presenting with metastatic disease of unknown origin may lead to misdirected diagnostic workup and/or therapy. We compared the phenotype of upper and lower GIT using an expanded immunohistochemical panel that included the traditional and newer gastrointestinal markers: SATB2, DcR3, MUC5AC, and MUC6. The panel was applied to resection specimens from 40 CRC, 40 GAC, and 40 EAC. A panel using SATB2, CK7, and CDX2 provided the best discriminating power for separating upper from lower GIT and was applied to 101 biopsies including 17 EAC, 17 GAC, 19 CRC, 18 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 15 cholangiocarcinomas, and 15 lung adenocarcinomas. The phenotype CK7/CDX2/SATB2 was moderately sensitive and highly specific of upper GIT, the phenotype CK7/CDX2/SATB2 was highly sensitive and specific for lower GIT, the phenotypes CK7/CDX2/SATB2 and CK7/CDX2/SATB2 favored pancreatobiliary or lung primaries. Less frequent phenotypes showed substantial overlap. Although strong diffuse expression of SATB2 was characteristic of CRC, weak and/or focal expression was present in one third or more of upper gastrointestinal, cholangiocarcinomas, and lung adenocarcinomas. DcR3, MUC5AC, and MUC6 improved specificity, but showed poor sensitivity, suggesting they should be used as second tier markers.</p>

<p>Assessment of the Ki67 index is critical for grading well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs), which can show a broad range of labeling that defines the WHO grade (G1-G3). Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PD-NECs) have a relatively high Ki67 index, &gt;20% in all cases and commonly exceeding 50%. After anecdotally observing PD-NECs with an unexpectedly low and heterogeneous Ki67 index following chemotherapy in 5 cases, we identified 15 additional cases of treated high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (HG-NENs). The study cohort comprised 20 cases; 11 PD-NECs, 8 mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1 WD-NET, G3 from various anatomic sites (gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and breast). The Ki67 index was evaluated on pretreatment (when available) and posttreatment samples. Topographic heterogeneity in the Ki67 index was expressed using a semi-quantitative score of 0 (no heterogeneity) to 5 (&gt;80% difference between maximal Ki67 and minimal Ki67 indices). Relative to the pretreatment group (n=9, mean Ki67 of 86.3%, range 80% to 100%), the neoplasms in the posttreatment group (n=20, mean Ki67 of 47.7%, range 1% to 90%) showed a significantly lower Ki67 index (18/20 cases). Of the 18 cases with a relatively low Ki67 index, 15 showed heterogeneous labeling (mean heterogeneity score of 2.3, range 1 to 5) and in 3 cases it was a homogeneously low. This phenomenon was observed in all subtypes of HG-NENs. In 6 cases, the alterations in Ki67 index following treatment were sufficient to place these HG-NENs in the WHO G1 or G2 grade, erroneously suggesting a diagnosis of WD-NET, and in 9 cases there was sufficient heterogeneity in the Ki67 index to suggest that a limited biopsy may sample an area of low Ki67, even though hotspot regions with a Ki67 index of &gt;20% persisted. In 7 cases, the alterations in the Ki67 index were accompanied by morphologic features resembling a WD-NET. These observations suggest that there is a potential for misinterpretation of previously treated PD-NECs as WD-NETs, or for assigning a lower grade in G3 WD-NETs. While the prognostic significance of treatment-associated alterations in Ki67 index is unknown, awareness of this phenomenon is important to avoid this diagnostic pitfall when evaluating treated NENs., Assessment of the Ki67 index is critical for grading well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs), which can show a broad range of labeling that defines the WHO grade (G1-G3).

<p>Emerging data suggest that type 1 diabetes affects not only the β-cell-containing islets of Langerhans, but also the surrounding exocrine compartment. Using digital pathology, machine learning algorithms were applied to provide high-resolution, whole-slide images of human pancreata to determine if the tissue composition in individuals with or at-risk for type 1 diabetes differs from those without diabetes. Transplant grade pancreata from organ donors were evaluated from 16 non-diabetic autoantibody negative controls, 8 non-diabetic autoantibody positive subjects who have increased-type 1 diabetes risk, and 19 persons with type 1 diabetes (0-12 years duration). HALO image analysis algorithms were implemented to compare architecture of the main pancreatic duct as well as cell size, density, and area of acinar, endocrine, ductal, and other non-endocrine, non-exocrine tissues. Type 1 diabetes was found to affect exocrine area, acinar cell density, and size while the type of difference correlated with the presence or absence of insulin-positive cells remaining in the pancreas. These changes were not observed before disease onset, as indicated by modeling cross-sectional data from pancreata of autoantibody positive subjects and those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. These data provide novel insights into anatomical differences in type 1 diabetes pancreata and demonstrate that machine learning can be adapted for the evaluation of disease processes from cross-sectional datasets., Emerging data suggest that type 1 diabetes affects not only the β-cell-containing islets of Langerhans, but also the surrounding exocrine compartment.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are characterized by fibrosis and an abundance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We investigated strategies to disrupt interactions among CAFs, the immune system, and cancer cells, focusing on adhesion molecule cadherin 11 (CDH11), which has been associated with other fibrotic disorders and is expressed by activated fibroblasts. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We compared levels of CDH11 mRNA in human pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer tissues and cells, compared with normal pancreas, and measured levels of CDH11 protein in human and mouse pancreatic lesions and normal tissues. We crossed p48-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+ (KPC) mice with CDH11-knockout mice and measured survival times of offspring. Pancreata were collected and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and (single-cell) RNA sequencing; RNA and proteins were identified by imaging mass cytometry. Some mice were given injections of PD1 antibody or gemcitabine and survival was monitored. Pancreatic cancer cells from KPC mice were subcutaneously injected into Cdh11+/+ and Cdh11-/- mice and tumor growth was monitored. Pancreatic cancer cells (mT3) from KPC mice (C57BL/6), were subcutaneously injected into Cdh11+/+ (C57BL/6J) mice and mice were given injections of antibody against CDH11, gemcitabine, or small molecule inhibitor of CDH11 (SD133) and tumor growth was monitored. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Levels of CDH11 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in CAFs than in pancreatic cancer epithelial cells, human or mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines, or immune cells. KPC/Cdh11+/- and KPC/Cdh11-/- mice survived significantly longer than KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice. Markers of stromal activation entirely surrounded pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice and incompletely in KPC/Cdh11+/- and KPC/Cdh11-/- mice, whose lesions also contained fewer FOXP3+ cells in the tumor center. Compared with pancreatic tumors in KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice, tumors of KPC/Cdh11+/- mice had increased markers of antigen processing and presentation; more lymphocytes and associated cytokines; decreased extracellular matrix components; and reductions in markers and cytokines associated with immunosuppression. Administration of the PD1 antibody did not prolong survival of KPC mice with 0, 1, or 2 alleles of Cdh11. Gemcitabine extended survival only of KPC/Cdh11+/- and KPC/Cdh11-/- mice or reduced subcutaneous tumor growth in mT3 engrafted Cdh11+/+ mice given in combination with the CDH11 antibody. A small molecule inhibitor of CDH11 reduced growth of pre-established mT3 subcutaneous tumors only if T and B cells were present in mice. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Knockout or inhibition of CDH11, which is expressed by CAFs in the pancreatic tumor stroma, reduces growth of pancreatic tumors, increases their response to gemcitabine, and significantly extends survival of mice. CDH11 promotes immunosuppression and extracellular matrix deposition, and might be developed as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>The nomenclature and classification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms has evolved in the last 15 years based on the advances in knowledge of the genomics, clinical behaviour and response to therapies. The current 2019 World Health Organization classification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms categorises them into three groups; pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs)(grade 1 grade 2, grade 3), pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) based on the mitotic rate, Ki-67 index, morphological differentiation and/or co-existing tissue subtype. PanNETs are also classified into non-functional NET, insulinoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, ACTH-producing NET and serotonin producing NET based on hormone production and clinical manifestations. A portion of the cases were associated with genetic syndromes such as multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN 1), neurofibromatosis and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In view of the distinctive pathology and clinical behaviour of PanNENs, the current 8th AJCC/UICC staging system has separated prognostic staging grouping for PanNETs from the pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas or MiNENs. Pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas and MiNENs are staged according to the prognostic stage grouping for exocrine pancreatic carcinoma. The new stage grouping of PanNETs was validated to have survival curves separated between different prognostic groups. This refined histological and staging would lead to appropriate selections of treatment strategies for the patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.</p>

<p>SMAD4 is an intracellular signaling mediator of the TGF-β pathway. Its mutation was commonly observed in gastrointestinal cancers, such as pancreatic cancer. The loss of SMAD4 on immunohistochemical staining is often used to suggest a pancreaticobiliary differentiation in evaluating a metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown origin. However, the function and molecular mechanism of SMAD4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development are largely unknown. Thus, we studied the correlation between SMAD4 mutations and clinico-molecular features in the patients with NSCLC. We reported the frequencies and prognostic values of SMAD4 mutations in a Chinese NSCLC cohort using next-generation sequencing. The NSCLC cases from several public databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas and others, were also used in this study to elucidate SMAD4-related molecular partners and mechanisms. Integrated bioinformatics analyses were conducted, such as analysis of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and survival analysis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tissues harboring SMAD4 mutations tended to show SMAD4 deficiency or loss, while SMAD4 expression was significantly reduced at all stages of NSCLC cases. We found that reduced SMAD4 expression was more frequent in the patients with poor disease-free survival and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. SMAD4 mutation was an independent risk factor for the survival of NSCLC patients. The expression of SMAD4 was associated with that of SMAD2. The GSEA showed that SMAD4 might promote NSCLC progression by regulating proliferation, adhesion, and immune response. In conclusion, these data suggest that SMAD4 mutation or loss as well as reduced expression can be used to identify the NSCLC patients with poor survival and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. SMAD4 may be a predictive marker or therapeutic target in NSCLC.

Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We retrospectively examined 431 patients who underwent upfront surgery with curative intent between 2007 and 2014. The association between clinical characteristics and survival outcomes was assessed by stratifying patients according to risk factors. The patients were categorized into four groups based on anatomical (resectable [R]/BR) and biological features (CA19-9 ≤500/&gt;500 U/mL): anatomical R with CA19-9 ≤500 U/mL (favorable-R); anatomical BR with CA19-9 ≤500 U/mL (favorable-BR); anatomical R with CA19-9 &gt;500 U/mL (risky-R); and anatomical BR with CA19-9 &gt;500 U/mL (risky-BR). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, 320 and 111 patients had anatomical R- and BR-PC, respectively. A modified Glasgow prognostic score = 2 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73), NLR&gt;5 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.54), CA19-9 &gt;500 U/mL (HR: 1.86), and anatomical BR (HR: 1.38) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The risky-R group had likely worse prognosis (16 months vs. 19 months, P = 0.0605) and a significantly higher early recurrence rate (36% vs 18%, P = 0.0231) than the favorable-BR group. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:It is essential to stratify and distinguish PC patients at a high risk of worse prognosis. Risky-R was an unfavorable prognostic factor and should thus be considered in the decision-making for treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in addition to anatomical BR-PC.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:This study explored the prognostic significance of Glypican (GPC) family genes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) after pancreaticoduodenectomy using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 112 PDAC patients from TCGA and 48 patients from GEO were included in the analysis. The relationship between overall survival and the expression of GPC family genes as well as basic clinical characteristics was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Joint effects survival analysis was performed to further examine the relationship between GPC genes and prognosis. A prognosis nomogram was established based on clinical characteristics and prognosis-related genes. Prognosis-related genes were investigated by genome-wide co-expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out to identify potential mechanisms of these genes affecting prognosis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In TCGA database, high expression of GPC2, GPC3, and GPC5 was significantly associated with favorable survival (log-rank P = 0.031, 0.021, and 0.028, respectively; adjusted P value = 0.005, 0.022, and 0.020, respectively), and joint effects analysis of these genes was effective for prognosis prediction. The prognosis nomogram was applied to predict the survival probability using the total scores calculated. Genome-wide co-expression and GSEA analysis suggested that the GPC2 may affect prognosis through sequence-specific DNA binding, protein transport, cell differentiation and oncogenic signatures (KRAS, RAF, STK33, and VEGFA). GPC3 may be related to cell adhesion, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, signaling pathways like Ras, Rap1, PI3K-Akt, chemokine, GPCR, and signatures like cyclin D1, p53, PTEN. GPC5 may be involved in transcription factor complex, TFRC1, oncogenic signatures (HOXA9 and BMI1), gene methylation, phospholipid metabolic process, glycerophospholipid metabolism, cell cycle, and EGFR pathway. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:GPC2, GPC3, and GPC5 expression may serve as prognostic indicators in PDAC, and combination of these genes showed a higher efficiency for prognosis prediction.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Advances in cross-sectional imaging have resulted in increased detection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and their management remains controversial. At present, there is no reliable non-invasive method to distinguish between indolent and high risk IPMNs. We performed extracellular vesicle (EV) analysis to identify markers of malignancy in an attempt to better stratify these lesions. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Using a novel ultrasensitive digital extracellular vesicle screening technique (DEST) we measured putative biomarkers of malignancy (MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, Das-1, STMN1, TSP1, TSP2, EGFR, EpCAM, GPC1, WNT-2, EphA2, S100A4, PSCA, MUC13, ZEB1, PLEC1, HOOK1, PTPN6, and FBN1) in EV from patient-derived cell lines and then on circulating EV obtained from peripheral blood drawn from patients with IPMNs. We enrolled a total of 133 patients in two separate cohorts: a clinical discovery cohort (n=86) and a validation cohort (n=47). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:From 16 validated EV proteins in plasma samples collected from the discovery cohort, only MUC5AC showed significantly higher levels in high grade lesions. Of the 11 patients with invasive IPMN (inv/HG), 9 had high MUC5AC expression in plasma EV and of the 11 patients with high grade dysplasia alone, only 1 had high MUC5AC expression (specificity of 82%, sensitivity of 100%). These findings were corroborated in a separate validation cohort. The addition of MUC5AC as a biomarker to imaging and high risk stigmata allowed detection of all cases requiring surgery, whereas imaging and high risk stigmata alone would have missed 5/14 cases (36%). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:MUC5AC in circulating EV can predict the presence of invasive carcinoma within IPMN. This approach has the potential to improve the management and follow-up of patients with IPMN including avoiding unnecessary surgery.</p>

<p>Nearly 25 years after its initial description, endoscopic therapy of walled-off pancreatic necrosis has become widely accepted. Endoscopic therapy is composed of transmural placement of stents, now most commonly lumen-apposing metal stents and removal of solid debris, if needed. Removal of solid debris can be achieved with irrigation provided by percutaneously or endoscopically placed (nasocystic) tubes or by mechanically through direct necrosectomy. This editorial provides commentary on the use of hydrogen peroxide instilled at the time of direct necrosectomy for treatment of walled-off pancreatic necrosis.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasms (SPNs) are rare low-grade malignant tumors with a marked preponderance for young females. Objective was to describe the morphology, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of SPNs in patients under 20 years of age and present a detailed review of literature. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 29 cases in patients under 20 years of age reported as SPN during the period January 2014 to December 2019, were included in the study. These included 19 resection specimens, 4 incision biopsies and 6 cases received as blocks for second opinion. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides as well as immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides of all cases were retrieved and reviewed by the authors. TFE3 and Progesterone Receptor were performed retrospectively. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Twenty-eight of the 29 patients were females. Ages of patients ranged from 12 to 19 years. Nineteen cases were resections. Tail was the commonest location. Mean tumor size was 9.5 cm. In 89.5% cases, tumor was confined to the pancreas. In 2 cases, distant metastasis was present. In 2 cases, extension beyond pancreas was seen. Solid and pseudopapillary areas were seen in all cases while other features were variable. Beta catenin and Cyclin D1 were positive in most cases while TFE3 was positive in 57% cases. Progesterone Receptor (PR) was positive in all 13 cases in which it was performed. Follow up was available in 14 patients. Follow up period ranged from 3 to 70 months. Twelve were alive and well without recurrence or metastasis while 2 were alive with recurrence and metastasis to liver and omentum respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Although many studies on SPNs have been published, surgeons, oncologists and even pathologists in this part of the world are often not aware of these rare tumors leading to inaccuracies and delays in diagnosis. In addition, this paper focusses on the interesting observation that the majority of SPNs diagnosed in our department during study period occurred in patients under 20 years of age (29 versus 21 in patients over 20). However, clinico-epidemiological, morphologic and prognostic features were similar in both age groups. Possibility of SPNs should always be considered in case of pancreatic neoplasms occurring in patients under 20 years of age as well. We believe that this is a very interesting and helpful study for the clinicians as well as the pathologists.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Stromal fibroblasts associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) play an important role in tumor progression through interactions with cancer cells. Our proposed combination strategies of in vitro and in silico biomarker screening through a cancer-stromal interaction model were previously identified several actin-binding proteins in human colon cancer stroma. The main aim of the present study was to identify novel prognostic markers in human PDAC stroma using our strategies. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Five primary cultivated fibroblasts from human pancreas were stimulated by two types of pancreatic cancer-cell-conditioned medium (Capan-1 and MIA PaCa-2) followed by gene expression analysis to identify up-regulated genes. Publicly available microarray data set concomitant with overall survival was collected and prognostic marker candidates were selected among the genes that were found to be up-regulated. The mRNA expression levels of the selected genes were evaluated in 5 human fresh PDAC tissues. Finally, survival analysis was performed based on immunohistochemical results on tissue microarrays consisting of 216 surgically resected PDAC tissues. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The microarray data of the cancer-stromal interaction model revealed that 188 probes were significantly regulated in pancreatic fibroblasts. Further, six genes were selected using publicly available microarray data set, and a single Diaphanous-related formin-3 (DIAPH3), actin-binding protein, was identified as a stromal biomarker in PDAC fibroblasts by RNA validation analysis. DIAPH3 exhibited strong immunohistochemical expression in stromal fibroblasts. The high stromal expression of DIAPH3 was associated with shorter survival times of PDAC patients. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:DIAPH3 was identified as a prognostic marker in PDAC fibroblasts using our biomarker screening strategies through the cancer-stromal interaction model, indicating that stromal actin-binding proteins might have an important biological role in cancer progression. These strategies were also available in PDAC, and can be used for stromal biomarker screening in various cancers.</p>

Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Retrospective study of PCLs &lt; 3 cm (2007-2016) undergoing EUS-FNA. Clinical, EUS and pancreatic cystic fluid (PCF) data were prospectively registered. Performance of EUS-FNA with PCF analysis for the detection of malignancy and accuracy in surgical cohort were analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We evaluated 115 patients with PCLs &lt; 3 cm who underwent EUS-FNA. 19 patients underwent surgery, 7 had malignant, 8 pre-malignant, and the remaining 4 benign lesions. Mass/mural nodule was present in 27% of the cysts, CEA level was higher than 192 ng/mL in 39.4% of patients, and only 35% of cytologic samples were informative.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The treatment options for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) have improved in recent years and consequently survival has increased. It is unknown, however, if elderly patients benefit from these improvements in therapy. With the ongoing aging of the patient population and an increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer, this patient group becomes more relevant. This study aims to clarify the association between increasing age, treatment and overall survival in patients with LAPC. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Post-hoc analysis of a multicenter registry including consecutive patients with LAPC, who were registered in 14 centers of the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group (April 2015-December 2017). Patients were divided in three groups according to age (&lt;65, 65-74 and ≥75 years). Primary outcome was overall survival stratified by primary treatment strategy. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to adjust for possible confounders.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) associated autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been recognized as a type of autoimmune disease that responds to corticosteroid. The diagnosis is based on elevation of the serum IgG4 level, abundance of IgG4 enhanced plasma cell infiltration in the portal region of the liver, and satisfaction of the criteria for “definite AIH” under the revised International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) scoring system. However, the clinical course of the disease is unclear. Label=“CASE PRESENTATION” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A 65-year-old man with jaundice and peripheral blood eosinophilia. His IAIHG and simplified score was compatible with definite AIH and his IgG4 level was elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal abnormalities in the hepatobiliary system or pancreas. A liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with IgG4 positive plasma cell infiltration in the portal region, without evidence of bile duct injury. He responded to 4-week period of induction prednisolone therapy and had no recurring symptoms under maintenance therapy of 5 mg prednisolone during the 3-year follow up. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This was a rare case that demonstrated an association between IgG4 associated AIH and the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia.</p>

<p>Hyalinized stroma (HS) is a dense, eosinophilic, and amorphous extracellular material in the stroma. HS is observed in several tumors; however, it has not been comprehensively studied in pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN). Here, we aimed to evaluate the immunohistochemical and microscopic characteristics of HS in IPMN and IOPN. The prevalence of HS was determined in 168 cases of IPMN, including intestinal type (IPMN-I), gastric type (IPMN-G), and pancreatobiliary type (IPMN-PB), as well as in 11 cases of IOPN. Immunohistochemical staining for laminin and collagen (types I, II, III, IV, and V), as well as Congo red staining were performed in IPMN and IOPN cases containing HS. The prevalence of HS among the IPMN and IOPN specimens was 1.2% (2/168 cases) and 45.5% (5/11 cases), respectively. The prevalence rates of HS in each IPMN subtype were as follows: 2.2% (2/91 cases) in IPMN-G, and 0% in IPMN-PB and IPMN-I. All seven HS cases were positive for collagen I, III, IV, and V but were negative for Congo red staining. Most cases showed negative, focal, or weak expression of laminin and type II collagen.

<p>Insulin-induced gene 2 (INSIG2) functions as a blocker of cholesterol biosynthesis and has been shown to be involved in colon and pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer pathophysiology; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Hence, our goal was to determine the role of INISG2 in breast cancer. INSIG2 mRNA and protein expression was correlated to metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of INSIG2 inhibited epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Conversely, overexpression of INSIG2 induced EMT. Knockdown of INSIG2 did not affect cell proliferation but resulted in altered metabolism in vitro and attenuated experimental metastasis in vivo. Analysis of breast cancer tissue microarrays revealed significantly higher INSIG2 protein expression in breast cancer tissues. INSIG2 protein expression was correlated to hormone receptor status with significantly higher expression in patients with triple negative (TNBC) and HER2- molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) however revealed significantly lower INSIG2 mRNA expression in TNBC patients. Higher INSIG2 mRNA expression was correlated to poor survival probability. Asian patients with high INSIG2 mRNA expression had significantly lower survival probability compared to Asian patients with low/medium INSIG2 mRNA expression. These results reveal a yet undefined role of INSIG2 in breast cancer, potentially more relevant for breast cancer patients in Asia., Insulin-induced gene 2 (INSIG2) functions as a blocker of cholesterol biosynthesis and has been shown to be involved in colon and pancreatic cancer pathogenesis.

<p>Gastric-type cervical adenocarcinoma (GCA) is an aggressive type of endocervical adenocarcinoma characterized by mucinous morphology, gastric-type mucin, lack of association with human papillomavirus (HPV) and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. We characterized the landscape of genetic alterations in a large cohort of GCAs, and compared it with that of usual-type HPV-associated endocervical adenocarcinomas (UEAs), pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PAs) and intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas (IGAs). GCAs (n = 68) were subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting 410-468 cancer-related genes. Somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) were determined using validated bioinformatics methods. Mutational data for UEAs (n = 21), PAs (n = 178), and IGAs (n = 148) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were obtained from cBioPortal. GCAs most frequently harbored somatic mutations in TP53 (41%), CDKN2A (18%), KRAS (18%), and STK11 (10%). Potentially targetable mutations were identified in ERBB3 (10%), ERBB2 (8%), and BRAF (4%). GCAs displayed low levels of CNAs with no recurrent amplifications or homozygous deletions. In contrast to UEAs, GCAs harbored more frequent mutations affecting cell cycle-related genes including TP53 (41% vs 5%, p &lt; 0.01) and CDKN2A (18% vs 0%, p = 0.01), and fewer PIK3CA mutations (7% vs 33%, p = 0.01). TP53 mutations were less prevalent in GCAs compared to PAs (41% vs 56%, p &lt; 0.05) and IGAs (41% vs 57%, p &lt; 0.05). GCAs showed a higher frequency of STK11 mutations than PAs (10% vs 2%, p &lt; 0.05) and IGAs (10% vs 1%, p &lt; 0.05). GCAs harbored more frequent mutations in ERBB2 and ERBB3 (9% vs 1%, and 10% vs 0.5%, both p &lt; 0.01) compared to PAs, and in CDKN2A (18% vs 1%, p &lt; 0.05) and KRAS (18% vs 6%, p &lt; 0.05) compared to IGAs. GCAs harbor recurrent somatic mutations in cell cycle-related genes and in potentially targetable genes, including ERBB2/3. Mutations in genes such as STK11 may be used as supportive evidence to help distinguish GCAs from other adenocarcinomas with similar morphology in metastatic sites.</p>

<p>The antimalarial artemisinins have also been implicated in the regulation of various cellular pathways including immunomodulation of cancers and regulation of pancreatic cell signaling in mammals. Despite their widespread application, the cellular specificities and molecular mechanisms of target recognition by artemisinins remain poorly characterized. We recently demonstrated how these drugs modulate inhibitory postsynaptic signaling by direct binding to the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we report the crystal structure of the central metabolic enzyme pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), which catalyzes the production of the active form of vitamin B6 (also known as pyridoxal 5’-phosphate [PLP]), in complex with artesunate at 2.4-Å resolution. Partially overlapping binding of artemisinins with the substrate pyridoxal inhibits PLP biosynthesis as demonstrated by kinetic measurements. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices and activity measurements of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a PLP-dependent enzyme synthesizing the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), define how artemisinins also interfere presynaptically with GABAergic signaling.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Inflammatory nutritional factors, such as the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), modified GPS (mGPS), and C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio, have prognostic values in many types of cancer. In this study, the prognostic values of inflammatory nutritional scores were evaluated in the patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 49 patients who underwent pancreatectomy after NACRT from September 2009 to May 2016 were enrolled. The NACRT consisted of hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) with concurrent S-1 (60 mg/m2) delivered 5 days/week for 2 weeks before pancreatectomy. Inflammatory nutritional scores were determined before and after NACRT in this series. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The median NLR increased after NACRT (from 2.067 to 3.302), with statistical difference (p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, high pre-NACRT mGPS (2 or 1; p = 0.0478) and significant increase in CRP/Alb ratio after NACRT (≧ 0.077; p = 0.0036) were associated with shorter overall survival. All patients were divided into two groups according to the ΔCRP/Alb ratio after NACRT: the group with high ΔCRP/Alb ratio (≧ 0.077) and the group with low ΔCRP/Alb ratio (&lt; 0.077). The group with high ΔCRP/Alb ratio after NACRT (n = 13) not only had higher post-NACRT CRP levels (p &lt; 0.001) but also had lower post-NACRT Alb levels (p = 0.002). Patients in the group with high ΔCRP/Alb ratio lost more body weight during NACRT (p = 0.03). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In addition to pre-NACRT mGPS, ΔCRP/Alb after NACRT could provide prognostic value in the patients with PDAC treated by NACRT.</p>

<p>Tumor budding has been reported to be an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Its use in daily diagnostics would improve the prognostic stratification of patients. We performed a multicenter interobserver study to test various budding assessment methods for their reproducibility. Two serial sections of 50 resected, treatment-naïve PDACs were stained for Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and pancytokeratin. Tumor budding was scored by independent observers at five participating centers in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada. Pathologists assessed tumor budding on a digital platform comparing H&amp;E with pancytokeratin staining in 10 high-power fields (10HPF) and one HPF hotspot (1HPF). Additionally, tumor budding was assessed in one H&amp;E hotspot at × 20 magnification, as suggested by the International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC). Correlation coefficients for bud counts between centers ranged from r = 0.58648 to r = 0.78641 for H&amp;E and from r = 0.69288 to r = 0.81764 for pancytokeratin. The highest interobserver agreement across all centers was observed for pancytokeratin 10HPFs (ICC = 0.6). ICC values were 0.49, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.4 for H&amp;E in 1HPF hotspot, H&amp;E in 10HPFs, pancytokeratin in 1HPF, and H&amp;E in one hotspot at ×20, respectively (ITBCC method). This interobserver study reveals a range between moderately poor to moderate agreement levels between pathologists for the different tumor budding assessment methods in PDAC. Acceptable levels of agreement were reached with the pancytokeratin 10HPF method, which can thus be recommended for the assessment of tumor budding in PDAC resection specimens. To improve the levels of interobserver agreement, the implementation of machine learning applications should be considered.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Immunotherapy is currently ineffective for nearly all pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas(PDAC), largely due to its tumor microenvironment(TME) that lacks antigen experienced T effector cells(Teffs). Vaccine-based immunotherapies are known to activate antigen-specific Teffs in the peripheral blood. To evaluate the effect of vaccine therapy on the PDAC TME, we designed a neoadjuvant and adjuvant clinical trial of an irradiated, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF)-secreting, allogeneic PDAC vaccine(GVAX). Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Eighty-seven eligible patients with resectable PDAC were randomly assigned(1:1:1) to receive GVAX alone or in combination with two forms of low-dose cyclophosphamide(Cy). Resected tumors following neoadjuvant immunotherapy were assessed for the formation of tertiary lymphoid aggregates(TLA) in response to treatment. The clinical endpoints are disease-free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The neoadjuvant treatment with GVAX either alone or with two forms of low dose Cy is safe and feasible without adversely increasing the surgical complication rate. Patients in Arm A who received neoadjuvant and adjuvant GVAX alone had a trend toward longer median OS(35.0 months) than that(24.8 months) in the historical controls who received adjuvant GVAX alone. However, Arm C, who received low dose oral Cy in addition to GVAX, had a significantly shorter DFS than Arm A. When comparing patients with OS&gt;24 months to those with OS&lt;15 months, longer OS was found to be associated with higher density of intratumoral TLA.

<p>Emerging data suggest that type 1 diabetes affects not only the β-cell-containing islets of Langerhans, but also the surrounding exocrine compartment. Using digital pathology, machine learning algorithms were applied to provide high-resolution, whole-slide images of human pancreata to determine if the tissue composition in individuals with or at-risk for type 1 diabetes differs from those without diabetes. Transplant grade pancreata from organ donors were evaluated from 16 non-diabetic autoantibody negative controls, 8 non-diabetic autoantibody positive subjects who have increased-type 1 diabetes risk, and 19 persons with type 1 diabetes (0-12 years duration). HALO image analysis algorithms were implemented to compare architecture of the main pancreatic duct as well as cell size, density, and area of acinar, endocrine, ductal, and other non-endocrine, non-exocrine tissues. Type 1 diabetes was found to affect exocrine area, acinar cell density, and size while the type of difference correlated with the presence or absence of insulin-positive cells remaining in the pancreas. These changes were not observed before disease onset, as indicated by modeling cross-sectional data from pancreata of autoantibody positive subjects and those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. These data provide novel insights into anatomical differences in type 1 diabetes pancreata and demonstrate that machine learning can be adapted for the evaluation of disease processes from cross-sectional datasets., Emerging data suggest that type 1 diabetes affects not only the β-cell-containing islets of Langerhans, but also the surrounding exocrine compartment.

<p>Among pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms, gastric, intestinal, and pancreatobiliary intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN), and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) have been defined, differing regarding association with invasive carcinoma and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help in the distinction of these neoplasms, but a proportion is unclassifiable using recommended markers. Hence, additional markers useful for the typing of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms are needed. The reported frequencies of the different types of IPMNs in surgical series vary to some extent, and such data based on Danish patients are currently lacking. Besides, the role of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in these neoplasms has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of different types of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms in a Danish cohort. Furthermore, we aimed to examine the utility of CD117, CK17, CK20, MUC4, and villin as markers for their distinction, in addition to the recommended markers MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6 and CDX2, and to evaluate the frequency of MMR deficiency. We typed 40 consecutively resected pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms according to the WHO criteria from 2019. IHC for CD117, CDX2, CK17, CK20, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUC1 (H23), MUC1 (Ma695), MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, PMS2, and villin was performed and evaluated using a five-tiered semiquantitative scale. A subset of the tumours was examined with PCR for microsatellite instability (MSI). Most tumours were intestinal (40 %) and gastric (40 %) IPMNs, followed by pancreatobiliary (17 %) IPMNs and IOPN (3 %). All cases were MMR proficient. We found a higher expression of MUC4, CK20 and villin in intestinal compared to gastric IPMNs (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001). MUC4 was more strongly expressed in intestinal compared to pancreatobiliary IPMNs, while the opposite was found for CK17 (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05). IOPN showed strong CD117 expression (score 4), while all gastric IPMNs were negative and 50 % and 29 % of intestinal and pancreatobiliary IPMNs only showed weak expression (score 1).

Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The records of 590 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at three institutes between 2012 and 2018 were included. The presence of a vascular wall abnormality or ascites with high density (vascular abnormality) on postoperative day (POD) 5-10 contrast-enhanced CT (early CT), perioperative characteristics, and any PPH or pseudoaneurysm formation (PPH events) were analyzed through a multivariate analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:PPH events occurred in 48 out of 590 patients (8%). The vascular abnormality on early CT and the C-reactive protein (CRP) value on POD 3 were independent risk factors for PPH events after POD5 (vascular abnormality: odds ratio 6.42, p = 0.001; CRP on POD 3: odds ratio 1.17, p = 0.016). The sensitivity of vascular abnormality for PPH events was 24% (7/29), and the positive predictive value was 30% (7/23). The combination of vascular abnormality and a high CRP value (≥15.5 mg/dL) on postoperative day 3 had a higher positive predictive value of 64% (7/11) than the vascular abnormality alone. None of the seven PPH events that occurred more than one month after surgery were foreseen via early CT. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The combination of vascular abnormality and high CRP value was associated with increasing risk of PPH events after pancreaticoduodenectomy, but the low sensitivity of early CT must be noted as an important shortcoming.

Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The records of 590 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at three institutes between 2012 and 2018 were included. The presence of a vascular wall abnormality or ascites with high density (vascular abnormality) on postoperative day (POD) 5-10 contrast-enhanced CT (early CT), perioperative characteristics, and any PPH or pseudoaneurysm formation (PPH events) were analyzed through a multivariate analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:PPH events occurred in 48 out of 590 patients (8%). The vascular abnormality on early CT and the C-reactive protein (CRP) value on POD 3 were independent risk factors for PPH events after POD5 (vascular abnormality: odds ratio 6.42, p = 0.001; CRP on POD 3: odds ratio 1.17, p = 0.016). The sensitivity of vascular abnormality for PPH events was 24% (7/29), and the positive predictive value was 30% (7/23). The combination of vascular abnormality and a high CRP value (≥15.5 mg/dL) on postoperative day 3 had a higher positive predictive value of 64% (7/11) than the vascular abnormality alone. None of the seven PPH events that occurred more than one month after surgery were foreseen via early CT. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The combination of vascular abnormality and high CRP value was associated with increasing risk of PPH events after pancreaticoduodenectomy, but the low sensitivity of early CT must be noted as an important shortcoming. The normal findings on early CT could not eliminate the risk of late PPH.</p>

<p>Insulin-induced gene 2 (INSIG2) functions as a blocker of cholesterol biosynthesis and has been shown to be involved in colon and pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer pathophysiology; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Hence, our goal was to determine the role of INISG2 in breast cancer. INSIG2 mRNA and protein expression was correlated to metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of INSIG2 inhibited epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Conversely, overexpression of INSIG2 induced EMT. Knockdown of INSIG2 did not affect cell proliferation but resulted in altered metabolism in vitro and attenuated experimental metastasis in vivo. Analysis of breast cancer tissue microarrays revealed significantly higher INSIG2 protein expression in breast cancer tissues. INSIG2 protein expression was correlated to hormone receptor status with significantly higher expression in patients with triple negative (TNBC) and HER2- molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) however revealed significantly lower INSIG2 mRNA expression in TNBC patients. Higher INSIG2 mRNA expression was correlated to poor survival probability. Asian patients with high INSIG2 mRNA expression had significantly lower survival probability compared to Asian patients with low/medium INSIG2 mRNA expression. These results reveal a yet undefined role of INSIG2 in breast cancer, potentially more relevant for breast cancer patients in Asia., Insulin-induced gene 2 (INSIG2) functions as a blocker of cholesterol biosynthesis and has been shown to be involved in colon and pancreatic cancer pathogenesis.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic resections are among the most technically demanding procedures, including a high risk of potentially life-threatening complications and outcomes strongly correlated to hospital volume and individual surgeon experience. Minimally invasive pancreatic resections (MIPRs) have become a part of standard surgical practice worldwide over the last decade; however, in comparison with other surgical procedures, the implementation of minimally invasive approaches into clinical practice has been rather slow. Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The aim of this study was to highlight and summarize the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of minimally invasive approaches in pancreatic surgery. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A WHO trial registry and Pubmed database literature search was performed to identify all RCTs comparing MIPRs (robot-assisted and/or laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy [DP] or pancreatoduodenectomy [PD]) with open pancreatic resections (OPRs). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall, five RCTs on MIPR versus OPR have been published and seven RCTs are currently recruiting. For DP, the results of two RCTs were in favor of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) in terms of shorter hospital stay and less intraoperative blood loss, with comparable morbidity and mortality. Regarding PD, two RCTs showed similar advantages for MIPD. However, concerns were raised after the early termination of the third multicenter RCT on MIPD versus open PD due to higher complication-related mortality in the laparoscopic group and no clear other demonstrable advantages. No RCTs on robot-assisted pancreatic procedures are available as yet. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:At the current level of evidence, MIDP is thought to be safe and feasible, although oncological safety should be further evaluated. Based on the results of the RCTs conducted for PD, MIPD cannot be proclaimed as the superior alternative to open PD, although promising outcomes have been demonstrated by experienced centers. Future studies should provide answers to the role of robotic approaches in pancreatic surgery and aim to identity the subgroups of patients or indications with the greatest benefit of MIPRs.</p>

<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) is a tumor suppressor in many cancers. However, its roles and action mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. Here, we analyzed MAP2K4 and its downstream kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) using immunohistochemical staining and their prognostic significances using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in our PDAC cohort. Then, we validated MAP2K4/JNK/p38 mRNA levels and prognostic significances using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Finally, we evaluated the effects of MAP2K4 on the proliferation and invasion of PDAC cells. MAP2K4, JNK, and p38 proteins were expressed in 97.3 % (72/74), 95.6 % (65/68), and 88.6 % (62/70) of the samples, respectively, and their levels in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in normal ducts. MAP2K4 protein expression was lower in male patients (p = 0.028). In our PDAC cohort, advanced TNM stage, low MAP2K4, and high JNK protein levels were significant prognostic factors for poor overall survival (OS) based on a univariate survival analysis (p = 0.006, p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). N stage and MAP2K4 and JNK protein levels were independent prognostic factors for OS based on multivariate analysis. We then built a prognosis prediction nomogram combining the standard TNM staging system with MAP2K4 and JNK expression that had a Harrell’s C-index of 0.645. The new prognosis prediction model effectively stratified the resected patients with PDAC, from both our cohort and TCGA database, into low- and high-risk groups. Finally, MAP2K4 overexpression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro. This study shows that reduced protein and mRNA levels of MAP2K4 found in PDAC patients, coupled to in vitro effects observed, support the tumor suppressor role of MAP2K4 in PDAC. Importantly, combining MAP2K4 and JNK expression with the TNM staging system results in a better prediction of postoperative survival of patients with PDAC., Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) is a tumor suppressor in many cancers.

The new prognosis prediction model effectively stratified the resected patients with PDAC, from both our cohort and TCGA database, into low- and high-risk groups. Finally, MAP2K4 overexpression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro. This study shows that reduced protein and mRNA levels of MAP2K4 found in PDAC patients, coupled to in vitro effects observed, support the tumor suppressor role of MAP2K4 in PDAC. Importantly, combining MAP2K4 and JNK expression with the TNM staging system results in a better prediction of postoperative survival of patients with PDAC.</p>

<p>Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) not only show cytoprotective role and their involvement in the development of anticancer drug resistance, but also transmit signals that control cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of GST isoforms in chemotherapy resistance remains elusive in pancreatic cancer. Here, we demonstrated that gemcitabine treatment increased the GSTM2 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GSTM2 by siRNA elevated apoptosis and decreased viability of pancreatic cancer cells treated with gemcitabine. Moreover, in vivo experiments further showed that shRNA induced GSTM2 downregulation enhanced drug sensitivity of gemcitabine in orthotopic pancreatic tumor mice. We also found that GSTM2 levels were lower in tumor tissues than in non-tumor tissues and higher GSTM2 expression was significantly associated with longer overall survival. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GSTM2 expression is essential for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells undergoing gemcitabine treatment and leads to chemo resistance. Downregulation of GSTM2 in pancreatic cancer may benefit gemcitabine treatment. GSTM2 expression in patients also shows significant correlation with overall survival. Thus, our study suggests that GSTM2 is a potential target for chemotherapy optimization and prognostic biomarker of pancreatic cancer., Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) not only show cytoprotective role and their involvement in the development of anticancer drug resistance, but also transmit signals that control cell proliferation and apoptosis.

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Mesothelin (MSLN) is a GPI-linked tumor antigen overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including ovarian, pancreatic, lung and triple-negative breast cancer. Early signs of clinical efficacy with MSLN-targeting agents have validated MSLN as a promising target for therapeutic intervention, but therapies with improved efficacy are still needed to address the significant, unmet medical need posed by MSLN-expressing cancers. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We designed HPN536, a 53-kDa, trispecific, T cell-activating protein-based construct (TriTAC), which binds to MSLN-expressing tumor cells, CD3ε on T cells and to serum albumin. Experiments were conducted to assess the potency, activity and half-life of HPN536 in in vitro assays, rodent models and in non-human primates.

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Concurrent gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment is one of the preferred chemotherapy regimens for metastatic and locally-advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Previous studies demonstrate that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is critical for nab-paclitaxel uptake into tumors and correlates with response. Gemcitabine increases nab-paclitaxel uptake by increasing Cav-1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that pre-treatment with gemcitabine would further enhance the sensitivity of PDAC to nab-paclitaxel by increasing Cav-1 expression and nab-paclitaxel uptake. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We investigated the sensitivity of different gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment regimens in a panel of PDAC cell lines and orthotopic xenograft models. The sensitivity of different treatment regimens was compared to the standard concurrent treatment. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Pre-treatment with gemcitabine before nab-paclitaxel increased Cav-1 and albumin uptake and significantly decreased proliferation and clonogenicity compared to concurrent treatment, which correlated with increased levels of apoptosis. Cav-1 silencing reduced the uptake of albumin and therapeutic advantage observed when cells were pre-treated with gemcitabine prior to nab-paclitaxel.

<p>A prerequisite for all HER2 directed therapies is the demonstration of HER2 receptor protein overexpression and/or gene amplification by in situ hybridization (ISH). ASCO and CAP have published several HER2 test guidelines over the past 15 years for both breast and gastric cancer. The latest version for breast cancer (2018) focuses on special issues of ISH related to the definitions of special diagnostic groups (1-5). The guidelines for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (2017), essentially based on ToGA trial data, are now also being used for other tumors such as pancreas, gallbladder, and non-small-cell lung cancer. For colorectal cancer, a modified testing procedure has been proposed. Recently, besides overexpression and amplification, a third type of HER gene alteration, namely mutation, has gained much interest. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows detection of both amplification and mutation of the HER2 gene providing new options of therapy especially in the case of activating mutations. Label=“ZUSAMMENFASSUNG” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Für die HER2-gerichtete Therapie ist der Nachweis einer Rezeptor-Überexpression und/oder der Genamplifikation mittels In-situ-Hybridisierung (ISH) von entscheidender Bedeutung. Im Laufe von mehr als 15 Jahren haben die Amerikanische Krebsgesellschaft (ASCO) und die Kanadisch-Amerikanische Pathologengesellschaft (CAP) mehrere Empfehlungen zur optimalen HER2-Testung verfasst. Für das Mammakarzinom wurde zuletzt 2018 eine Aktualisierung herausgegeben, wobei für die Interpretation von ISH-Befunden spezielle diagnostische Gruppen (1-5) definiert wurden. Die vor allem auf der ToGA-Studie basierende Empfehlung für das Magenkarzinom (2017) wird häufig auch als Leitlinie für die Testung anderer gastrointestinaler Tumoren, einschließlich Pankreas und Gallenwege, und das Bronchialkarzinom verwendet. Als Entscheidungsgrundlage für HER2-gerichtete Therapien dient neuerdings als dritte Form der HER2-Genalteration (neben Überexpression und Amplifikation) auch der Mutationsnachweis. Dieser erfolgt mit Hilfe des Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) und eröffnet im Falle einer aktivierenden HER2-Mutation neue Therapieoptionen.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Surgical researchers seek to publish their findings in esteemed surgical journals to advance science and their careers. A detailed investigation of study and manuscript attributes in a specific research area, like pancreatic neoplasia, may yield informative insights for researchers looking to maximize research impact. Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:We analyzed publications related to pancreatic surgery primarily focused on pancreatic and periampullary tumors in order to identify elements associated with acceptance into high impact journals and a high likelihood of future citations. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A comprehensive review of nine surgical journals was performed between 2010-19. Journals were grouped based on impact factor into high (&gt;3), medium (1-3) and low (&lt;1) impact categories. Each publication was annotated to identify study topic, methodology and statistical approach. Findings were compared according to journal impact and number of citations to identify predictors of success across these two domains. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 1,044 out of 21,536 (4.8%) articles published in the index journals were related to pancreatic tumors. The most common focus of study was perioperative outcomes and complications (46.7%). There was significantly more number of authors, participating institutions, countries, and randomized clinical trials in higher impact journals as well as high-cited articles (p&lt;0.05). Though advanced statistical analysis was used more commonly in high-impact journals (p&lt;0.05), it did not translate to higher citations (p&gt;0.05). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pancreatic neoplasia continues to be extensively studied in surgical literature. Specific elements of study methodology and design were identified as potentially key attributes to acceptance in high impact journals and citation success.</p>

The median time to surgery was 27 days (interquartile range, 17-40 days). The best dichotomous threshold for 24-month overall survival (OS) was 30 days. The median OS was similar between groups with time to surgery of fewer than 30 days and time to surgery of 30 days or more (25 vs 21 months, P = 0.609). Similar results were found for median recurrence-free survivals (19 vs 15 months, P = 0.561). On Cox regressions, time to surgery was not associated with shorter OS. Only lymph node invasion and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent OS predictors (hazard ratio, 2.610, P = 0.006, and hazard ratio, 2.042, P = 0.001).

Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Forty-one patients were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2017 (median age, 68 years; 51% male; stage II, 95%). Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel met the tolerability criteria in 39 of the 40 patients included in the tolerability analysis set (97.5%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were leukopenia, neutropenia, alopecia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. After a follow-up of 30.1 months, median disease-free survival was 17.0 months and median overall survival was not reached.

Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Cohort A and cohort B included 617,042 and 29,472 SOT recipients, respectively. In cohort A, the annual incidence rate was 12.78 per 100,000 in kidney-pancreas, 13.34 in liver, and 21.87 in heart-lung transplant recipients. Receiving heart-lung transplant, 50 years or older, and history of cancer (in either recipient or donor) were independent factors associated with PAC. Fifty-two patients developed PAC in cohort B.

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Endoscopic pancreatic function tests are used to diagnose pancreatic diseases and are a viable source for the discovery of biomarkers to better characterize pancreatic disorders. However, pancreatic fluid (PF) contains active enzymes that degrade biomolecules. Therefore, we tested how preservation methods and time to storage influence the integrity and quality of proteins and nucleic acids. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We obtained PF from 9 subjects who underwent an endoscopic pancreatic function test. Samples were snap frozen at the time of collection; after 1, 2, and 4 hours on ice; or after storage overnight at 4°C with or without RNase or protease inhibitors (PIs). Electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis determined protein abundance and quality, whereas nucleic acid integrity values determined DNA and RNA degradation. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Protein degradation increased after 4 hours on ice and DNA degradation after 2 hours on ice. Adding PIs delayed degradation. RNA was significantly degraded under all conditions compared with the snap frozen samples. Isolated RNA from PF-derived exosomes exhibited similar poor quality as RNA isolated from matched PF samples. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Adding PIs immediately after collecting PF and processing the fluid within 4 hours of collection maintains the protein and nucleic acid integrity for use in downstream molecular analyses.</p>

<p>Label=“ABSTRACT” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Despite great progress in the treatment of pancreatic cancer under the efforts of researchers, the survival time of patients with pancreatic cancer is shorter than that of patients with other cancers. Thus, we have a great need for innovative therapeutic methods, including research and development of new drugs and innovation of administration methods. Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles wrapped by a lipid bilayer. Thanks to the low clearance ratio and strong specificity of exosomes in circulation, together with in-depth research on the surface protein of exosomes and a targeted modification method, there is a strong potential to apply exosomes in the transfer and even targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics, RNA, and natural products. Particularly, exosomes carrying microRNA show good application prospects in cancer therapy. This article is intended to summarize the progress of research relating to the treatment of pancreatic cancer via exosomal microRNAs.</p>

<p>Label=“ABSTRACT” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders leading to hospitalization. It has long been debated whether biliary AP, about 30% to 50% of all cases, is induced by bile acids (BAs) when they reach the pancreas via reflux or via the systemic blood circulation.Besides their classical function in digestion, BAs have become an attractive research target because of their recently discovered property as signaling molecules. The underlying mechanisms of BAs have been investigated in various studies. Bile acids are internalized into acinar cells through specific G-protein-coupled BA receptor 1 and various transporters. They can further act via different receptors: the farnesoid X, ryanodine, and inositol triphosphate receptor. Bile acids induce a sustained Ca2+ influx from the endoplasmic reticulum and release of Ca2+ from acidic stores into the cytosol of acinar cells. The overload of intracellular Ca2+ results in mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent acinar cell necrosis. In addition, BAs have a biphasic effect on pancreatic ductal cells. A more detailed characterization of the mechanisms through which BAs contribute to the disease pathogenesis and severity will greatly improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and may allow for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies for gallstone-inducedAP.</p>

DNA methylation-based profiling is now routinely used in the diagnostic workup of brain tumors. This has been enabled by the availability of cost-efficient array-based platforms. We have extended these efforts to augment histopathological diagnosis in neuroendocrine tumors. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We compiled data of 69 small-intestinal, pulmonary, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. These data were used to build a ridge regression calibrated random forest classification algorithm (NEN-ID) that predicts the origin of tumor samples with high accuracy (&gt; 95%). The model was validated during 3x3 nested cross validation and tested in a local and external cohort (n = 198 cases). In addition, we show that our diagnostic approach is robust across a range of possible confounding experimental parameters such as tumor purity and array quality. A software infrastructure and online user interface was built to make the model available to the scientific community. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:This DNA methylation-based prediction model can be used in the workup for patients with neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary. To facilitate validation and clinical implementation, we provide a user-friendly, publicly available web-based version of NEN-ID.</p>

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:The goal of this study was to analyze the role of somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) as a molecular target for the imaging and treatment of thyroid cancer (TC) through analysis of SSTR2 expression and its epigenetic modulation and testing tumor uptake of different radiolabeled SSTR2 analogs. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We analyzed SSTR2 expression by immunostaining of 92 TC tissue samples and quantified standard uptake values (SUVmax) of SSTR2 analog 68Ga-DOTATATE by positron emission/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in 25 patients with metastatic TC. We utilized human TC cell lines characterized by differential SSTR2 expression (TT, BCPAP, FTC133) and rat pancreatic cell line (AR42J) with intrinsically high SSTR2 expression for functional in vitro studies. SSTR2-high (AR42J) and SSTR2-low (FTC133) xenograft mouse models were used to test the uptake of radiolabeled SSTR2 analogs and its therapeutic efficacy in vivo Results: TC had a higher SSTR2 expression than normal thyroid. Hurthle cell TC was characterized by the highest 68Ga-DOTATAE uptake (median SUVmax 16.5 [7.9-29]) than other types of TC. In vivo studies demonstrated that radiolabeled DOTA-EB-TATE, is characterized by significantly higher tumor uptake than DOTA-TATE (p&lt;0.001) and DOTA-JR11 (p&lt;0.001). Treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE extended survival and reduced tumor size in a mouse model characterized by high SST-analogs uptake (SUVmax 15.16±4.34) but had no effects in a model with low SST-analogs uptake (SUVmax 4.8±0.27). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:A novel SST-analog, 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE, has the potential to be translated from bench to bedside for the targeted therapy of patients characterized by high uptake of SST- analogs in metastatic lesions.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is aggressive, with an overall five-year survival rate of 9%, and few patients are candidates for pancreatectomy at presentation. The role of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is evolving, especially for high-risk potentially resectable tumors. Due to the increasing number of NAT resection specimens, we aim to characterize the histologic changes associated with NAT, and to compare two tumor regression grading schemes. 118 resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were selected from the cases between 2011-2018, 59 not treated and 59 treated with NAT. All H&amp;E stained tumor slides were reviewed for histologic changes and graded using the four-tier modified Ryan score (recommended by College of American Pathologists) and the three-tier MD Anderson score. The histologic changes evaluated included blue/grey fibrosis, islet cell hyperplasia, dystrophic calcification, amyloid deposition, cholesterol clefts, nerve hypertrophy, elastotic stromal/vascular change, abscess formation, and eosinophilic tumor cell changes. There were statistically significant differences for dystrophic calcification, eosinophilic tumor cell changes, elastotic stromal/vascular change, islet cell hyperplasia, and nerve hypertrophy between the two groups, with these features seen more frequently in NAT cases. Blue/grey stromal fibrosis was present in all cases regardless of NAT, except few complete regression cases and one treated case with intraneural invasion only. Blue/grey fibrosis is a useful histologic visual clue to suggest the possibility of adjacent tumor in the majority of PDAC cases regardless of NAT. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, neither grading scheme correlated with overall survival in our cohort. However, the MD Anderson score was significantly correlated with both time to primary tumor recurrence (p=0.002) and time to distant recurrence (p=0.04); while the modified Ryan score did not., Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is aggressive, with an overall five-year survival rate of 9%, and few patients are candidates for pancreatectomy at presentation.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND AND AIM” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Oncogenic KrasG12D induces neoplastic transformation of pancreatic acinar cells through acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), an actin-based morphogenetic process, and drives pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2) contain Rptor and Rictor, respectively, and are activated downstream of KrasG12D thereby contributing to PDAC. Yet, whether and how mTORC1 and mTORC2 impact on ADM and the identity of the actin nucleator(s) mediating such actin rearrangements remain unknown. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A mouse model of inflammation-accelerated KrasG12D-driven early pancreatic carcinogenesis was used. Rptor, Rictor and Arpc4 (Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4) were conditionally ablated in acinar cells to deactivate the function of mTORC1, mTORC2 and the Actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex, respectively. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We found that mTORC1 and mTORC2 are markedly activated in human and mouse ADM lesions, and cooperate to promote KrasG12D-driven ADM in mice and in vitro. They utilize the Arp2/3 complex as a common downstream effector to induce the remodeling the actin cytoskeleton leading to ADM. In particular, mTORC1 regulates the translation of Rac1 (Rac family small GTPase 1) and the Arp2/3-complex subunit Arp3, whereas mTORC2 activates the Arp2/3 complex by promoting Akt/Rac1 signaling. Consistently, genetic ablation of the Arp2/3 complex prevents KrasG12D-driven ADM in vivo. In acinar cells, the Arp2/3 complex and its actin-nucleation activity mediated the formation of a basolateral actin cortex, which is indispensable for ADM and pre-neoplastic transformation. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Here, we show that mTORC1 and mTORC2 attain a dual, yet non-redundant regulatory role in ADM and early pancreatic carcinogenesis by promoting Arp2/3 complex function. Thus, the role of Arp2/3 complex as a common effector of mTORC1 and mTORC2 fills the gap between oncogenic signals and actin dynamics underlying PDAC initiation.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Despite controversy regarding the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, nearly half of resected patients do not receive chemotherapy postoperatively. This study aimed to examine whether use of NAC compensates for omission of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Adults with resected stages 1 to 3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled from the National Cancer Database NCDB (2006-2016). Overall survival (OS) analyses were used to examine the impact of NAC on those who did not receive AC. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The study analyzed a national cohort of 56,286 patients: 30% without chemotherapy, 11% with NAC, 54% with AC, and 5% with NAC plus AC. Use of NAC increased by more than 400% from 2006 to 2016, whereas the rates for omission of chemotherapy remained unchanged. The OS rates were similar between the patients who received NAC and those who received AC (hazard ratio, 0.97; p = 0.21). Among the patients who did not receive AC, NAC was associated with improved OS (26.7 vs. 18.4 months; p &lt; 0.0001). The patients who did not receive AC but underwent NAC had a median OS comparable with the OS of those who received AC alone (26.9 vs. 24.7 months). In the adjusted analysis, the use of NAC for those without AC was significantly associated with improved OS (estimate, - 0.24; p &lt; 0.0001). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Although data are limited regarding the survival benefit derived from neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, nearly half of patients do not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that the use of NAC lessens the survival disadvantage caused by omission of AC. Despite controversy, NAC may be considered for pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients given the high likelihood that adjuvant chemotherapy will be omitted.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The use of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing. While there is an association between NAT and improved post-pancreatectomy complication rates in limited patient populations, the strength of the relationship and its applicability to a broader and modern pancreatectomy cohort remains unclear. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We used the 2014-2018 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project to evaluate NAT use for PDAC patients undergoing pancreatectomy. We also used propensity score matching techniques to compare 30-day postoperative outcomes, including clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) and delayed gastric emptying (DGE), between patients selected for NAT versus upfront surgery. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Patients receiving NAT were more likely to undergo vascular resections (33% vs. 16%, p &lt; 0.001), have perioperative transfusions (18% vs. 12%, p &lt; 0.001), and undergo longer procedures. Rates of CR-POPF (6%, vs. 10%, p &lt; 0.001), DGE (11% vs. 13%, p = 0.016), postoperative percutaneous drainage (9% vs. 12%, p &lt; 0.001), and SSI (15% vs. 18%, p &lt; 0.001) were lower for patients selected for NAT. The association of NAT with CR-POPF remained statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.42-0.66) after adjustment for operative technique, gland texture, and need for vascular resection for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, but not for patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Among PDAC patients undergoing resection, selection for NAT is associated with fewer CR-POPFs, postoperative procedural interventions, and infectious complications, particularly for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. These associations should be considered in discussions of multidisciplinary treatment sequencing for patients with PDAC.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive gastrointestinal malignancies despite multimodality therapy. In the last several years, genomic studies have revealed that carcinogenesis is driven largely by key driver mutations that can be targeted for oncologic therapy. In addition, advances in cancer immunology have identified receptors and monoclonal antibodies that can be manipulated into harnessing the power of the host’s immune system for antitumor treatment. These strategies have generated a paradigm shift in the management of several cancer types, including those in the gastrointestinal tract. However, there are several complicating factors when translating the results to pancreatic cancer, including the dense, fibrotic stroma unique to this disease that may shield the cancer cells from both cytotoxic and immunologic agents. Although the majority of trials have been performed in the metastatic setting, this review will focus on both the historic studies that have defined this field as well as the emerging data arising from ongoing efforts to exploit newly discovered mutations and their druggable targets.</p>

<p>With major advancements and frequently utilization of abdominal imaging techniques, hepatic cysts are increasingly encountered in clinical practice. Although the majority of cysts are benign, a small subset represent neoplastic precursors to cholangiocarcinoma. These cystic precursors include intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct (IPNB) and mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver (MCN-L), and bear striking pathologic resemblance to corresponding cystic neoplastic precursors within the pancreas. This review examines the salient clinical, gross, microscopic and molecular features of IPNBs and MCN-Ls, and, in particular, provides histopathologic comparison to their pancreatic counterparts. Considering these neoplasms may be diagnostically challenging, we also discuss other hepatic lesions within the differential diagnosis, and the potential for molecular methods to improve their preoperative evaluation and the early detection of cholangiocarcinoma.</p>

Label=“SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:SCNs of the pancreas are invariably benign entities. While consensus about their management is lacking, surgical resection still plays a role. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Presumed SCNs evaluated from 1990 to 2018 were included. Indications for surgery, predictors of resection, rate and predictors of misdiagnosis in the surgical cohort and time trends of management strategies were the main outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A total of 672 presumed SCNs were included. Presence of symptoms (37%) and large size (34.1%) were the most frequent indications for surgery. Symptoms (60.4 vs 19.0%, p &lt; 0.001), size (45 vs 30 mm, p &lt; 0.001), solid components (19.7 vs 6.2%, p &lt; 0.001), thick walls (14.4 vs 5.6%, p = 0.001) and main pancreatic duct dilation (13.4 vs 5.6%, p = 0.004) were associated with upfront resection (n = 134, 19.9%). Upfront resection decreased over time and 15.4% of patients eventually crossed over to surgery. Increase in size (6,9 vs 1,3 mm/year), development of symptoms (25.3 vs 3.4%, p &lt; 0.001), solid component (6.0 vs 1.4%, p = 0.010) or jaundice (3.6 vs 0.7%, p = 0.028) were associated with crossing over to surgery. Major morbidity and mortality occurred in 17.1% and 1.7% of patients, respectively. Misdiagnosis occurred mostly in case of macrocystic/unilocular lesions of the body-tail. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:In the real-life scenario, SCNs still represent an indication for surgery particularly once large and symptomatic. During surveillance, resection occurs mostly in younger individuals for body/tail lesions. Evidence-based consensus on appropriate indications for surgery is urgently needed.</p>

<p>Pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) is a rare primary pancreatic neoplasm of uncertain origin and low malignant potential that typically affects young females, mostly in their third decade of life. There are only a few reports on fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology diagnosis of this neoplasm. We report one such case which was diagnosed based on cytomorphologic and immunocytochemical features on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided FNA smears. A 24-year-old woman presented to the gastroenterology clinic with 3-month history of epigastric pain, anorexia, and weight loss (10 kg over same time period). Abdominal CT revealed a large (13X11 cm) heterogeneous cystic lesion occupying most of the pancreatic body. EUS examination confirmed the presence of a large mixed cystic-solid lesion occupying most of the pancreatic body and neck. EUS-guided FNA smears showed tumor cells in sheets with papillary/pseudo-papillary and acinar formation. The tumor cells had abundant clear and vacuolated cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with bland chromatin. PAS staining revealed positively stained capillary networks at the core of the papillary/pseudo-papillary structures. In addition, there were PAS positive intra-cytoplasmic and extra-cellular globules which were diastase resistant. Immuno-cytochemical staining on direct smears revealed positive reaction for cyclinD1, vimentin, CD56, beta-catenin, CD10 and progesterone receptor. Thus, this is the example of an extremely rare neoplasm which had a typical clinical and imaging setting, and could be conclusively diagnosed because of characteristic cytomorphological and immunocytochemical features.</p>

<p>The antimalarial artemisinins have also been implicated in the regulation of various cellular pathways including immunomodulation of cancers and regulation of pancreatic cell signaling in mammals. Despite their widespread application, the cellular specificities and molecular mechanisms of target recognition by artemisinins remain poorly characterized. We recently demonstrated how these drugs modulate inhibitory postsynaptic signaling by direct binding to the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we report the crystal structure of the central metabolic enzyme pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), which catalyzes the production of the active form of vitamin B6 (also known as pyridoxal 5’-phosphate [PLP]), in complex with artesunate at 2.4-Å resolution. Partially overlapping binding of artemisinins with the substrate pyridoxal inhibits PLP biosynthesis as demonstrated by kinetic measurements. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices and activity measurements of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a PLP-dependent enzyme synthesizing the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), define how artemisinins also interfere presynaptically with GABAergic signaling.

Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In a multi-institutional cohort of 305 primary PDAC resection specimens, myeloid cells were abundant, enriched within stromal regions, highly heterogeneous across tumors, and differed by somatic genotype. High densities of CD15+ARG1+ immunosuppressive granulocytic cells and M2-polarized macrophages were associated with worse patient survival. Moreover, beyond cell density, closer proximity of M2-polarized macrophages to tumor cells was strongly associated with disease-free survival, revealing the clinical significance and biologic importance of immune cell localization within tumor areas.

<p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor family, is a common receptor found in the intestine and liver, and helps to maintain systemic metabolic homeostasis through regulating bile acid, glucose, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostatsis. In addition, FXR regulates the functions of various organs, such as liver, intestine, kidney, breast, pancreas, cardiovascular system and brain. FXR also plays a key role in regulation of gut-microbiota through mediating the various signaling pathways. Accordingly, FXR has become an attractive therapeutic target in a variety of diseases. This review combines classical and recent research reports to introduce the basic information about FXR and its important roles in various organs of the body.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Microscopically positive margins (R1) negatively impact survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). For patients with close/positive margins, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) can improve local control. The prognostic impact of an R1 resection in patients who receive total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT; FOLFIRINOX with chemoradiation) and IORT is unknown. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively collected for borderline/locally advanced (BR/LA) PDAC patients who received TNT and underwent resection between 2011 and 2019. Disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) measured from time of diagnosis were compared between groups. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Two hundred one patients received TNT and were resected, with a median DFS and OS of 24 months and 47 months, respectively. Eighty-eight patients (44%) received IORT; of these, 69 (78%) underwent an R0 and 19 (22%) an R1 resection. There was no significant difference in clinicopathologic factors between the IORT and no-IORT groups, except for resectability status (LA: IORT 69%, no-IORT 53%, p = 0.021) and surgeons’ concern for a positive/close margin. R1 resection was associated with worse DFS and OS in the no-IORT population. However, among patients who received IORT, there was no difference in DFS (R0: 29 months, IQR 14-47 vs R1: 20 months, IQR 15-28; p = 0.114) or OS (R0: 48 months, IQR 25-not reached vs R1: 37 months, IQR 30-47; p = 0.307) between patients who underwent R0 vs R1 resection. In multivariate analysis, within the IORT group, R1 resection was not associated with DFS or OS. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:IORT may mitigate the adverse effect of an R1 resection on DFS and OS in BR/LA PDAC patients receiving TNT.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Some presumed resectable pancreatic cancer patients harbor radiographically occult metastases that are incidentally identified at the time of abdominal exploration. This study aims to identify novel diagnostic or predictive microRNA (miRNA) markers for subclinical peritoneal dissemination in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing abdominal exploration. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Peritoneal lavage fluid samples were harvested from 74 patients with pancreatic cancer at the time of staging laparoscopy. Microarray analysis was performed using peritoneal lavage fluids with positive and negative cytology. Candidate microRNA expression was quantified and validated by droplet-digital PCR assays. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In the miRNA array analysis, miR-593-3p showed significant upregulation in peritoneal lavage fluids with positive cytology. Of the 74 patients validated, peritoneal lavage fluids with positive cytology had significantly higher expression of miR-593-3p than those with negative cytology (P &lt; 0.001). Even in cases with no peritoneal dissemination and negative cytology, multivariate analysis revealed that elevated miR-593-3p expression was significantly correlated with worse overall survival than those with low expression (hazard ratio: 3.474, P = 0.042). Of the 48 patients who underwent pancreatectomy, multivariate analysis also demonstrated that higher expression of miR-593-3p in peritoneal lavage was the only significant poor prognostic marker influencing both overall survival (hazard ratio: 23.38, P = 0.005) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 5.700, P = 0.002). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Elevated miR-593-3p expression in peritoneal lavage suggests the presence of subclinical micrometastasis even in cases with localized pancreatic cancer, and miR-593-3p could be a useful prognostic predictor for pancreatic cancer patients undergoing staging laparoscopy.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis, even after curative resection.

We searched for genes predictive of poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer using a public database and validated the survival impact of the selected gene in a patient cohort. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We used a public database to search for genes associated with early pancreatic cancer recurrence. As a validation cohort, 201 patients who underwent radical resection in our institution were enrolled. Expression of the target gene was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We evaluated growth and invasiveness using small interfering RNAs, then performed pathway analysis using gene set enrichment analysis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We extracted ARHGEF2 from GSE21501 as a gene with a high hazard ratio (HR) for early recurrence within 1 year. The high ARHGEF2 expression group had significantly poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) and poorer overall survival (OS) than the low ARHGEF2 expression group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high ARHGEF2 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for RFS (HR 1.92) and OS (HR 1.63). In vitro, ARHGEF2 suppression resulted in reduced cell growth and invasiveness. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that ARHGEF2 expression was associated with MYC, G2M, E2F, and CDC25A expression, suggesting that c-Myc and cell cycle genes are associated with high ARHGEF2 expression. IHC revealed a positive correlation between ARHGEF2 and c-Myc expression.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The prognostic role of resection margins in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is debated. This study aimed to investigate the impact that global and individual resection margin status after pancreatic head resection for PDAC has on disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Surgical specimens of pancreaticoduodenectomy/total pancreatectomy performed for PDAC were examined with a standardized protocol. Surgical margin status (biliary, pancreatic neck, duodenal, anterior and posterior pancreatic, superior mesenteric vein groove and superior mesenteric artery margins) was classified as the presence of malignant cells (1) directly at the inked surface (R1 direct), (2) within less than 1 mm (R1 ≤ 1 mm), or (3) with a distance greater than 1 mm (R0). Patients with a positive neck margin at the final histology were excluded from the study. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 362 patients included in the study, 179 patients (49.4 %) had an R0 resection, 123 patients (34 %) had an R1 ≤ 1 mm resection, and 60 patients (16.6 %) had an R1 direct resection. The independent predictors of DFS were R1 direct resection (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49), R1 ≤ 1 mm resection (HR, 1.38), involvement of one margin (HR, 1.36), and involvement of two margins or more (HR, 1.55). When surgical margins were analyzed separately, only R1 ≤ 1 mm superior mesenteric vein margin (HR, 1.58) and R1 direct posterior margin (HR, 1.69) were independently associated with DFS. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Positive R status is an independent predictor of DFS (R1 direct and R1 ≤ 1 mm definitions) and of DSS (R1 direct). The presence of multiple positive margins is a risk factor for cancer recurrence and poor survival. Different surgical margins could have different prognostic roles.</p>

We aimed at comparing EUS-FNA with EUS-FNB in terms of Ki-67 proliferative index (PI) estimation capability, cellularity of the samples, and reliability of Ki-67 PI/tumor grading compared with surgical specimens. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients diagnosed with pNETs on EUS and/or surgical specimens were retrospectively identified. Specimens were re-evaluated to assess Ki-67 PI feasibility, sample cellularity by manual counting, and determination of Ki-67 PI value. Outcomes in the EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB groups were compared. Kendall rank test was used for Ki-67 PI correlation between EUS and surgical specimens. Subgroup analysis including small (≤20 mm), non-functioning pNETs was performed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Three-hundred samples from 292 lesions were evaluated: 69 EUS-FNA cytology and 231 EUS-FNB histology. Ki-67 PI feasibility was similar for EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB (91.3% vs. 95.7%, p = 0.15), while EUS-FNB performed significantly better in the subgroup of 179 small pNETs (88.2% vs. 96.1%, p = 0.04). Rate of poor cellulated (&lt;500 cells) specimens was equal between EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB. A significant correlation for Ki-67 PI values between EUS and 92 correspondent surgical specimens was found in both groups, but it was stronger with EUS-FNB (tau = 0.626, p &lt; 0.0001 vs. tau = 0.452, p = 0.031). Correct grading estimation was comparable between the two groups (p = 0.482). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our study showed stronger correlation for Ki-67 values between EUS-FNB and surgical specimens, and that EUS-FNB outperformed EUS-FNA in the evaluation of small pNETs.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:/Objectives: Endoscopic ultrasound elastography (EUS-EG) is useful for diagnosis of small solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs), particularly in excluding pancreatic cancer (PC), but its dependence on main pancreatic duct dilatation (MPDD) has not been examined. We aimed to investigate EUS-EG for diagnosis of small SPLs with and without MPDD. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients with pathologically diagnosed SPLs of ≤20 mm were included and retrospectively analyzed. Using the blue:green ratio, an EUS-EG image was classified as blue-dominant, equivalent, or green-dominant. Using multiple EUS-EG images per patient, a lesion with a greater number of blue-dominant than green-dominant images was classified as stiff, and the others as soft. EUS-EG images in random order were judged by three raters. Considering stiff SPLs as PC, diagnostic performance of EUS-EG was examined for SPLs with and without MPDD. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 126 cases analyzed, 65 (52%) were diagnosed as PC, and 63 (50%) had MPDD. A total of 1077 EUS-EG images were examined (kappa coefficient = 0.783). Lesions were classified as stiff in 91 cases and soft in 35 (kappa coefficient = 0.932). The ratio of stiff to soft lesions was significantly higher in PC than in non-PC (62:3 vs. 29:32, P &lt; 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of a stiff lesion with vs. without MPDD for diagnosis of PC were 94%, 23%, and 50% vs. 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Using the EUS-EG stiffness classification for small SPLs, PC can be excluded with high confidence and concordance for a soft lesion without MPDD.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Despite neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) being increasingly utilized and possibly associated with improved oncological outcomes, the impact of NAC on textbook outcomes following pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains debated. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database of patients undergoing resection of non-metastatic PDAC from 2004 to 2016 was performed. Propensity score matching was used to account for treatment selection bias in patients with and without NAC (noNAC). A multivariable binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the association of NAC with length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, and 30- and 90-day mortality. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of 7975 (11%) NAC patients and 65,338 (89%) noNAC patients, 2911 NAC and 2911 noNAC patients remained in the cohort after matching. Clinicopathologic and demographic variables were well-balanced after matching. After matching, NAC was associated with significantly lower rates of 30-day readmission (5.5% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.006), which remained after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.92; p = 0.006). There were no significant differences in LOS and 30- and 90-day mortality in patients receiving NAC and noNAC. Stratified analyses by surgery type (i.e. pancreaticoduodenectomy [PD] and distal pancreatectomy [DP]) demonstrated consistent results. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Receipt of NAC in PDAC patients undergoing DP or PD is associated with lower readmission rates and does not otherwise compromise short-term outcomes. These data reaffirm the safety of strategies incorporating NAC and is important to consider when devising policies aimed at quality improvement in achieving textbook outcomes.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) rarely metastasizes to the brain; therefore, the features of brain metastasis of PDAC are still unknown. We encountered simultaneous metastases to the brain and lung in a PDAC patient after curative surgery. Case presentation A 68-year-old man with PDAC in the tail of the pancreas underwent distal pancreato-splenectomy. He received gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months. Two months later, brain and lung metastases occurred simultaneously. Considering the systemic condition, the patient received gamma knife treatment and an Ommaya reservoir was inserted for drainage. The patient’s condition gradually worsened and he received the best supportive care. To the best of our knowledge, only 28 cases in which brain metastases of PDAC were identified at the time of ante-mortem have been reported to date, including the present case. Notably, the percentage of simultaneous brain and lung metastases was higher (32%) in a series of reviewed cohorts. Thus, lung metastasis might be one of the risk factors for the development of brain metastasis in patients with PDAC. As a systemic disease, it can be inferred that neoplastic cells will develop brain metastasis via hematogenous dissemination beyond the blood-brain barrier, even if local recurrence is controlled. In our case, immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), mucin core protein 1 (MUC1), and MUC5AC in the resected primary PDAC. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:We describe a case of simultaneous brain and lung metastases of PDAC after curative pancreatectomy, review previous literature, and discuss the clinical features of brain metastasis of PDAC.</p>

The EchoTip ProCore 20G® (PC20), a 20-gauge biopsy needle with a forward-bevel core trap, has been available in Japan since 2015. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We compared the efficacy of the PC20 with that of the EchoTip ProCore 22G® (PC22) and Acquire 22G® (AC22) in EUS-FNA/B for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. This retrospective study included 191 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent EUS-FNA/B using the PC20, PC22, or AC22 at our facility from April 2013 to October 2019. We investigated the patients’ clinical characteristics and the diagnostic accuracy and safety of each needle. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A sufficient stroke length of puncture was secured in all patients. The maximum length under EUS was shorter with the AC22 (22.1 ± 2.2 mm) than PC20 (30.6 ± 0.7 mm, p &lt; 0.01) and PC22 (30.3 ± 0.8 mm, p &lt; 0.01). The histological accuracy was 96.4% with the PC20 but only 58.8% with the PC22 (adjusted p (p-adj) &lt; 0.0001) and 75.0% with the AC22 (p-adj = 0.06). The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of histology and cytology was 96.4% with the PC20, while it was 72.1% with the PC22 (p-adj &lt; 0.0001) and 91.7% with the AC22 (p-adj &gt; 0.99). One patient (0.9%) in the PC20 group developed mild pancreatitis, but no adverse events occurred with the other needles. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The PC20 showed better diagnostic capability than the PC22. The diagnostic efficacy was similar between the PC20 and AC22.

However, only a few studies have revealed the relationship between metabolic syndrome and the occurrence of AP. We therefore elucidated the association between metabolic syndrome and the occurrence of AP. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A total of 705 patients admitted to our hospital from January 2016 to December 2018 were included in the study. Subjects were divided into case and control groups according to their diagnosis: (1) According to the revised Atlanta classification from 2012, patients diagnosed with AP were enrolled in the case group. (2) Patients without a history of AP or any disease related to metabolic syndrome were allocated into the control group. Controls were matched to cases individually by sex and age (control/case ratio = 1). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The incidence rate of metabolic syndrome in AP patients was 30.9%, which was more frequent than that in controls (13.2%) (OR 2.837; 95% CI 1.873-4.298, p &lt; 0.001). In the multivariate regression analysis, a history of smoking or alcohol consumption and biliary stones were significantly associated with AP (OR 2.441; 95% CI 1.865-5.172, p &lt; 0.001; OR 1.777; 95% CI 1.060-2.977, p = 0.029; OR 28.995; 95% CI 13.253-63.435, p &lt; 0.001).

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) represent a heterogenous group of tumors. Findings from the phase III NETTER-1 trial showed that treatment of unresectable/metastatic progressive gastrointestinal (GI) NETs with 177Lu-Dotatate resulted in a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care (BSC) with high dose octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) 60 mg. A health economic analysis was performed using input data from clinical studies and data derived from an indirect comparison to determine the cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-Dotatate in the treatment of GI-NETs and pancreatic NETs (P-NETs) in Scotland. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the payer perspective using a three-state partitioned survival model. In the base case 177Lu-Dotatate was compared with BSC in gastrointestinal (GI)-NETs using clinical data from the NETTER-1 trial. A secondary analysis comparing 177Lu-Dotatate with BSC, everolimus or sunitinib in patients with P-NETs was also performed using hazard ratios inferred from indirect comparisons. The base case analysis was performed over a 20-year time horizon with an annual discount rate of 3.5% for both costs and clinical outcomes. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:For unresectable/metastatic progressive GI-NETs treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate led to a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.33 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with BSC due to extended PFS and OS. Mean total lifetime costs were GBP 35,701 higher with 177Lu-Dotatate, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 26,830 per QALY gained. In analyses in patients with P-NETs 177Lu-Dotatate was associated with ICERs below GBP 30,000 per QALY gained in comparisons with BSC, sunitinib and everolimus. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrated that, in Scotland, from the payer perspective, 177Lu-Dotatate at the set acquisition cost is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with unresectable or metastatic progressive GI-NETs or P-NETs.</p>

Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In total, 236 cytology specimens from 223 patients were identified, of which 108 (45.8%) had corresponding histology samples. The main reason for cyto-histological discrepancy was sampling error. Interpretive error was identified in one case. Overall, sensitivity was 92.5%, specificity was 100%, diagnostic accuracy of cytology was 95%, false-positive rate was 0% and false-negative rate was 7.5%. The implementation of the new reporting system reduced the number of cases in the atypical category. All cases previously categorised as suspicious or malignant remained in the same category.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:This study investigated the safety and feasibility of intraoperative portal vein blood (PVB) collection at the time of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) resection. Relationships of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in PVB and peripheral blood (PB) with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival were studied. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Patients undergoing PDAC resection were offered enrollment in a prospective liquid biopsy protocol. The patients had PB drawn before incision and PVB drawn before tumor mobilization, then again immediately after resection. Using standard CellSearch protocols, CTCs were identified and compared with OS. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of the 34 patients enrolled in this study, 23 (68%) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 8 (23%) underwent distal pancreatectomy, and 3 (9%) underwent total pancreatectomy. Peripheral blood was available for 22 (65%) and PVB for 31 (91%) of the patients. No bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred with the PVB draws. The CTC counts per 7.5 mL of PVB collected before and after resection were highly correlated (R2 = 0.89). The study found CTCs in 11 (50%) of 22 PB samples and 22 (71%) of 31 PVB samples. The OS rate at 18 months was 92% for the patients with &lt; 3 CTCs, 71% for the patients with ≥ 3 CTCs per 7.5 mL of PB (p = 0.30), 100% for the patients without PVB CTCs, and 70% for the patients with PVB CTCs (p &lt; 0.01). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Collection of PVB during PDAC resection is safe. In this pilot study, PVB CTC counts but not PB CTC counts were significantly correlated with OS. This opens the door for future studies on selective omission of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients treated preoperatively and tailored surveillance intensity for patients without PVB CTCs at PDAC resection.</p>

Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Surgical resection after neoadjuvant treatment is the mainstay of treatment and should involve margin-negative resection with regional lymphadenectomy. Several recently completed randomized controlled clinical trials have defined the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with BRPC. The utilization of chemoradiation remains controversial. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The definition of BRPC goes beyond the anatomic relationship between the tumor and vessels. We need to include biological and conditional dimensions. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery are associated with improved outcomes of BRPC. Understanding the molecular features of pancreatic cancer should lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers as well as a more personalized approach to guide individualized therapy.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) is a proto-oncogene involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. AGR2, predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is also a secreted protein detected in the extracellular compartment in multiple cancers. However, the biological functions of intracellular and extracellular AGR2 remain to be elucidated. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Based on the biochemical structure of AGR2 protein, PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells stably expressing ER-resident or secreted AGR2 were generated by a lentivirus-mediated stable overexpression system. The capacities of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and survival were assessed in PANC-1 stable cells. Moreover, EGFR expression and activation were determined to explore the possible mechanism of AGR2 roles in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:It was discovered that secreted AGR2, but not ER-resident AGR2, promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion of PANC-1 cells. Moreover, the data indicated that both the ER-resident and the secreted AGR2 enhance the survival capacity of PANC-1 cells after tunicamycin-induced ER stress and gemcitabine treatment. However, EGFR expression and activation were not found to be involved in AGR2-dependent oncogenic phenotypes in PANC-1 cells. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Secreted AGR2 is predominantly involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Both secreted and ER-resident AGR2 contribute to the survival of PANC-1 cells under the challenging conditions. These findings provide insight into how different localizations of AGR2 have contributed to pancreatic cancer growth, metastasis, and drug sensitivity.</p>

Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We investigated the utility of the 21-gauge Menghini-type biopsy needle with the rolling method for the histological diagnosis of AIP, in comparison with conventional 22-gauge needles. Among total 28 patients, rate of definitive histological diagnosis, acquired sample area of tissue, rate of histopathological diagnosis of AIP, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Definitive histological diagnoses were successfully accomplished in all 14 patients (100%) treated with a Menghini-type needle, and in 57% of cases (8/14) treated with conventional 22-gauge needles (P &lt; 0.001). The median sample area of the tissue, except for blood contamination, was remarkably larger by the Menghini-type needle than by conventional-type needles (6.2 [IQR, 4.5-8.8] versus 0.7 [IQR, 0.2-2.0] mm2, P &lt; 0.001), and the area per punctures was approximately 4 times larger (1.4 [IQR: 0.9-2.9] versus 0.3 [IQR: 0.1-0.6] mm2/puncture, P &lt; 0.001). Based on the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, abundant IgG4-postive cells, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis were found in 86%/29%, 64%/0%, 36%/0%, and 7%/0% patients who were treated with the Menghini-type needle and conventional-type needles, respectively. Consequently, histopathological diagnosis with type 1 AIP (lever 1 or 2) was achieved in 9 patients (64%) treated with the Menghini-type needle and in no patient treated with conventional-type needles (P &lt; 0.001). Two patients who had mild post-procedural pancreatitis improved with conservative treatment, and no bleeding occurred in patients treated with the Menghini-type needle. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:EUS-guided rolling method with the 21-gauge Menghini-type biopsy needle is useful for the histopathological diagnosis of AIP, due to its abundant acquisition of good-quality tissue from the pancreas.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extensive metastasis. EMT plasticity plays a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis by maintaining the transition between EMT and MET states. Our aim is to understand the molecular events regulating metastasis and EMT plasticity in pancreatic cancer. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The interactions between a cancer promoting zinc transporter ZIP4, a zinc dependent EMT transcriptional factor ZEB1, a co-activator YAP1, and integrin α3 (ITGA3) were examined in human pancreatic cancer cells, clinical specimens, spontaneous mouse models (KPC and KPCZ) and orthotopic xenografts, and 3D spheroid and organoid models. Correlations between ZIP4, miR-373, and its downstream targets were assessed by RNA in situ hybridization and IHC staining. The transcriptional regulation of ZEB1, YAP1, ITGA3 by ZIP4 was determined by ChIP, Co-IP and luciferase reporter assays. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The Hippo pathway effector YAP1 is a potent transcriptional co-activator and forms a complex with ZEB1 to activate ITGA3 transcription through the YAP1/TEAD binding sites in human pancreatic cancer cells and KPC derived mouse cells. ZIP4 upregulated YAP1 expression via activation of miR-373 and inhibition of the YAP1 repressor LATS2. Furthermore, upregulation of ZIP4 promoted EMT plasticity, cell adhesion, spheroid formation and organogenesis both in human pancreatic cancer cells, 3D spheroid model, xenograft model, and spontaneous mouse models (KPC and KPCZ) through ZEB1/YAP1-ITGA3 signaling axis.

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and pancreatic β cells require receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) to develop and function properly. Degeneration of ICCs is linked to diabetic gastroparesis. The mechanisms linking diabetes and gastroparesis are unclear, but may involve miRNA mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing in KIT+ cells. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We performed miRNA-seq analysis from isolated ICCs in diabetic mice and plasma from patients with idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis. miR-10b-5p target genes were identified and validated in mouse and human cell lines. For loss-of-function studies, we used KIT+ cell-restricted mir-10b knockout mice and KIT+ cell depletion mice. For gain-of-function studies, a synthetic miR-10b-5p mimic was injected in multiple diabetic mouse models. We compared the efficacy of miR-10b-5p mimic treatment vs. antidiabetic and prokinetic medicines. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:miR-10b-5p is highly expressed in ICCs from healthy mice, but drastically depleted in ICCs from diabetic mice. A conditional knockout of mir-10b in KIT+-cells or depletion of KIT+-cells in mice leads to degeneration of β cells and ICCs, resulting in diabetes and gastroparesis. miR-10b-5p targets the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11), which negatively regulates KIT expression. The miR-10b-5p mimic or Klf11 siRNAs injected into mir-10b knockout mice, diet-induced diabetic mice, and TALLYHO polygenic diabetic mice rescues the diabetes and gastroparesis phenotype for an extended period of time. Furthermore, the miR-10b-5p mimic is more effective in improving glucose homoeostasis and GI motility as compared with common antidiabetic and prokinetic medications. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:miR-10b-5p is a key regulator in diabetes and gastrointestinal dysmotility via the KLF11-KIT pathway. Restoration of miR-10b-5p may provide therapeutic benefits for these disorders.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer and is associated with significant post-operative morbidity and mortality. Patients eligible for surgery, increasingly receive neo-adjuvant therapy before surgery or adjuvant therapy afterward, inherently exposing them to toxicity. As such, optimizing physical function through exercise during treatment remains imperative to optimize quality of life either before surgery or during rehabilitation. However, current exercise efficacy and prescription in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Therefore, this study aims to summarise the published literature on exercise studies conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment with a focus on determining the current prescription and progression patterns being used in this population. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A systematic review of four databases identified studies evaluating the effects of exercise on aerobic fitness, muscle strength, physical function, body composition, fatigue and quality of life in participants with pancreatic cancer undergoing treatment, published up to 24 July 2020. Two reviewers independently reviewed and appraised the methodological quality of each study. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Twelve studies with a total of 300 participants were included. Heterogeneity of the literature prevented meta-analysis. Exercise was associated with improvements in outcomes; however, study quality was variable with the majority of studies receiving a weak rating. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:High quality evidence regarding the efficacy and prescription of exercise in pancreatic cancer is lacking. Well-designed trials, which have received feedback and input from key stakeholders prior to implementation, are required to examine the impact of exercise in pancreatic cancer on key cancer related health outcomes.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (UCOGC) of the pancreas is a very rare variant of pancreatic malignant neoplasm. It is regarded as a highly aggressive tumor with a worse prognosis than conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Label=“CASE PRESENTATION” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A 54-year-old male patient presented with 3-month recurrent epigastric distress. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a large cystic mass in the distal pancreas. On macroscopic examination, the lesion had numerous multiloculated cystic cavities. Microscopically, the tumor predominantly comprised a considerable number of evenly distributed non-neoplastic osteoclast-like giant cells and a few neoplastic pleomorphic cells. Although extensive histologic sampling was conducted, a classic ductal adenocarcinoma component was not identified. The patient received no further treatment after his surgery and has been doing well with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis for &gt;7 years. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Our results suggest that pure UCOGC has a significantly better prognosis and supports that pure UCOGC may represent a biologically distinct variant of pancreatic carcinoma and it should be separated from other undifferentiated pancreatic carcinomas.</p>

<p>In the gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) tract, neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) include well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and high-grade NE carcinomas (NECs), which are thought to make up separate and mutually exclusive tumor entities. Little is known, however, as to whether there may be any pathogenetic link between them. Clustering analysis of a 10-gene panel generated from a previously reported next-generation sequencing analysis on 48 GEP-NENs with clinical annotations was used in the study. Unsupervised cluster analysis showed three histology-independent clusters, namely, C1, C2, and C3, which accounted for 44% of patients but the entire array of mutations. All but two NECs fell into the clusters, yet with different prevalence rates (p &lt; 0.0001). A model was devised according to which NETs were likely to evolve into NECs upon progression of C3 into C1 and C2, despite different morphology. The median Ki-67 labeling index was 5% in C3 showing better prognosis and 50% in C1 and C2 experiencing worse prognosis, with an impressive intra-tumor heterogeneity of diversely proliferating tumor areas. This study suggests that a subset of large cell NECs in the gastroenteropancreatic tract may evolve from pre-existing well-differentiated NETs.</p>

<p>Endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma (EMPSGC) is a rare adnexal tumor with a predilection for the skin of the eyelid. It has also been reported in other areas of the face. Extra facial location has rarely been reported. They are twice as common in the females as compared to men and frequently affect the elderly between 50 and 80 years of age. It is a low-grade carcinoma with no reported cases of metastases, although a few cases with recurrences have been reported. Since it was first described by Flieder et al. in 1997, fewer than 60 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe one such case of EMPSGC in an adult male occurring at an unusual location, the peno-scrotal junction with systemic metastases to bilateral inguinal and iliac lymph nodes, multiple bones, and pancreas. Unlike previously reported cases, our patient worsened rapidly and succumbed to the disease six months after initiation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of its kind in modern published literature.</p>

Label=“Aims” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:To study histopathology of the umbilical lesions and review pertinent literature on the embryological basis of these lesions. Label=“Subjects and Methods” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:We reviewed cases of umbilical lesions and classified them as “developmental” and “others.” Developmental cases were sub-classified based on the mechanism as those due to defect in the closure of body wall, defect in the closure of the umbilical ring, persistence of embryonic remnants, or failure of epithelization. Persistent embryonic remnants were subdivided into fistula, sinus, and cyst. Histology of all the cases was studied and the different types of tissue in omphalomesenteric ducts (OMD) remnants were identified. Label=“Statistical Analysis Used” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Descriptive statistics were used as required. Label=“Results” NlmCategory=“UNASSIGNED”:Seventy-one cases in the age range of 1 day to 13 years were studied and male preponderance was noted. The developmental lesions included 4 omphalocele sacs with dense acute inflammation, 2 umbilical hernial sacs with fibrocollagenous tissue, 30 OMD remnants, 10 allantoic duct remnants, 19 umbilical granulomas, and 2 cases showing more than one developmental mechanism. Four cases were classified as “others” including 3 epidermal inclusion cysts and 1 skin tag. Among OMD remnants, sinuses (arising from the distal tract) were found to be the most common. Histological examination of the OMD remnants showed enteric (18), enteric and gastric (5), colonic (4), enteric and colonic (2), and pancreatic and enteric and gastric mucosae (1).

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common causes of “peritoneal carcinomatosis” and has an insidious growth pattern. Thus, it falls into the differential diagnosis of other peritoneal malignancies including malignant mesothelioma. Recently, we have encountered an undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma presenting with peritoneal disease and exhibiting immunoreactivity to calretinin, mimicking mesothelioma. In this study, we explored the incidence of calretinin expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Label=“MATERIALS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Calretinin immunohistochemical staining was performed on the tissue microarrays (TMAs), which were created using three 0.6 mm diameter punches per tumor (n=113). Distribution and intensity of expression were evaluated. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The TMAs contained 86 well/moderately differentiated and 27 poorly differentiated/undifferentiated carcinomas. Calretinin was positive in nine tumors (8%); six with diffuse and strong staining, three with focal and/or weak staining. The incidence of calretinin expression was 15% in poorly differentiated/undifferentiated carcinomas (vs. 6% in well/moderately differentiated carcinomas, p=0.03). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, especially when poorly differentiated/undifferentiated, may be diffusely and strongly positive for calretinin creating a potential diagnostic challenge with malignant mesothelioma. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using this marker to explore a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Tumors expressing calretinin without other mesothelial markers should prompt a careful evaluation of the morphologic and immunohistochemical features to exclude other malignancies. If the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is considered, ductal differentiation can be demonstrated by using additional immunohistochemical markers such as mucin-related glycoproteins (MUC1, MUC5AC) and/or oncoproteins (CEA, B72.3, CA125).</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Novel biomarkers and molecular monitoring tools hold potential to improve outcome for patients following resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We hypothesized that the combined longitudinal analysis of mutated cell-free plasma KRAS (cfKRASmut) and CA 19-9 during adjuvant treatment and follow-up might more accurately predict disease course than hitherto available parameters. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Between 07/2015 and 10/2018, we collected 134 plasma samples from 25 patients after R0/R1-resection of PDAC during adjuvant chemotherapy and post-treatment surveillance at our institution. Highly sensitive discriminatory multi-target ddPCR assays were employed to screen plasma samples for cfKRASmut. cfKRASmut and CA 19-9 dynamics were correlated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients were followed-up until 01/2020. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Out of 25 enrolled patients, 76% had undergone R0 resection and 48% of resected PDACs were pN0. 17/25 (68%) of patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 22.0 months, with 19 out of 25 (76%) patients relapsing during study period. Median RFS was 10.0 months, median OS was 22.0 months. Out of clinicopathologic variables, only postoperative CA 19-9 levels and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy correlated with survival endpoints. cfKRASmut. was detected in 12/25 (48%) of patients, and detection of high levels inversely correlated with survival endpoint. Integration of cfKRASmut and CA 19-9 levels outperformed either individual marker. cfKRASmut outperformed CA 19-9 as dynamic marker since increase during adjuvant chemotherapy and follow-up was highly predictive of early relapse and poor OS. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Integrated analysis of cfKRASmut and CA 19-9 levels is a promising approach for molecular monitoring of patients following resection of PDAC. Larger prospective studies are needed to further develop this approach and dissect each marker’s specific potential.</p>

<p>Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) are the second most common epithelial tumors of the pancreas. Despite improvements in prognostic grading and staging systems, it remains a challenge to predict the clinical behavior of panNENs and the response to specific therapies given the high degree of heterogeneity of these tumors. Most panNENs are nonfunctional and present as advanced disease. However, systemic therapies provide modest benefits. Therefore, there is a need for predictive biomarkers to develop personalized treatment and to advance new drug development. The somatostatin receptors remain the only clinically established prognostic and predictive biomarkers in panNENs. Oncogenic drivers are at a very low frequency. Commonly mutated genes in panNENs include MEN1, chromatin remodeling genes (DAXX and ATRX), and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway genes. In contrast, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (panNECs), which carry a very poor prognosis, have distinctive mutations in certain genes (eg, RB1 and p53). Ongoing research to integrate epigenomics will provide tremendous opportunities to improve current understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and provide invaluable insight into the biology of these tumors, new drug development, and establishing personalized therapies., Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) are the second most common epithelial tumors of the pancreas.

<p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) has become an important area of investigation with respect to improving prognosis in malignancies. Here we evaluated TME prognostic risk in small intestinal adenocarcinomas based on histologic assessment of tumor budding at the peritumoral-invasive front (pTB) and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs). pTB and sTILs were analyzed in 230 surgically resected small intestinal adenocarcinomas, as recommended by the International Tumor Budding Consensus Conference (ITBCC) and the International TILs Working Group (ITWG). On the basis of high levels of pTB count (≥10) and sTIL density (≥20%), we combined pTB and sTIL to produce a collective TME-based prognostic risk index: low-risk (pTBLow/sTILHigh; n=39, 17.0%), intermediate-risk (pTBLow/sTILLow or pTBHigh/sTILHigh; n=99, 43.0%), and high-risk groups (pTBHigh/sTILLow; n=92, 40.0%). TME risk index provided better prognostic stratification than the individual pTB and sTIL (14.9 vs. 6.7 vs. 10.3). Tumors with higher TME prognostic risk were associated with an infiltrative growth pattern and nonintestinal immunophenotype (both P=0.001), pancreatic invasion (P=0.010), lymphovascular (P&lt;0.001) or perineural invasion (P=0.006), higher T-category (P&lt;0.001), N-category (P=0.004), and stage grouping (P=0.002), and KRAS mutation (P=0.008). In multivariate analysis, higher TME prognostic risk index (P&lt;0.001), distal tumor location and nonintestinal immunophenotype (both P=0.001), higher N-category (P&lt;0.001), and microsatellite stable (P=0.015) were worse-independent prognosticators. TME prognostic risk index consistently stratified patient survival regardless of tumor location (P&lt;0.001 in proximal; P=0.002 in distal), stages (P&lt;0.001 in lower stages I to II; P=0.028 in stage III), and DNA mismatch repair gene status (P&lt;0.001 in microsatellite stable; P=0.001 in microsatellite instability). TME risk index is a powerful prognostic predictor for risk stratification of patients with small intestinal adenocarcinoma.</p>

<p>Somatic LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition has been detected in early embryos, adult brains, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and many cancers, including epithelial GI tumors. We previously found numerous somatic L1 insertions in paired normal and GI cancerous tissues. Here, using a modified method of single-cell analysis for somatic L1 insertions, we studied adenocarcinomas of colon, pancreas, and stomach, and found a variable number of somatic L1 insertions in tumors of the same type from patient to patient. We detected no somatic L1 insertions in single cells of 5 of 10 tumors studied. In three tumors, aneuploid cells were detected by FACS. In one pancreatic tumor, there were many more L1 insertions in aneuploid than in euploid tumor cells. In one gastric cancer, both aneuploid and euploid cells contained large numbers of likely clonal insertions. However, in a second gastric cancer with aneuploid cells, no somatic L1 insertions were found. We suggest that when the cellular environment is favorable to retrotransposition, aneuploidy predisposes tumor cells to L1 insertions, and retrotransposition may occur at the transition from euploidy to aneuploidy. Seventeen percent of insertions were also present in normal cells, similar to findings in genomic DNA from normal tissues of GI tumor patients. We provide evidence that: 1) The number of L1 insertions in tumors of the same type is highly variable, 2) most somatic L1 insertions in GI cancer tissues are absent from normal tissues, and 3) under certain conditions, somatic L1 retrotransposition exhibits a propensity for occurring in aneuploid cells., Somatic LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition has been detected in early embryos, adult brains, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and many cancers, including epithelial GI tumors.

Vaccine-based immunotherapies are known to activate antigen-specific Teffs in the peripheral blood. To evaluate the effect of vaccine therapy on the PDAC TME, we designed a neoadjuvant and adjuvant clinical trial of an irradiated, GM-CSF-secreting, allogeneic PDAC vaccine (GVAX).

<p>PubMed: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33448017" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=33448017</a></p>
<p>The prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains dismal. Multiple genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated the nuclear receptor NR5A2 in modulating PDAC risk, but mechanisms for this association are not understood. NR5A2 is a transcription factor that maintains acinar cell identity, and heterozygous loss of Nr5a2 in mice accelerates oncogenic KRAS-driven formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a PDAC precursor derived from acinar cells. In a recent issue of The Journal of Pathology, Cobo et al. characterize a novel mouse model that uses Ptf1a:Cre to drive oncogenic Kras as well as heterozygous Nr5a2 inactivation. In addition to the expected PanIN lesions, these mice exhibited a surprising phenotype: large pancreatic cystic lesions which have not been previously reported. Comparing expression of oncogenic Kras and heterozygous Nr5a2 in various mouse models reveals several possible explanations for these cystic lesions. Importantly, these differences across mouse models suggest that NR5A2 may contribute to PDAC precursors in ways beyond its previously characterized acinar cell autonomous role. These observations highlight that pathways implicated by GWAS may have roles in unexpected cell types, and an understanding of these roles will be critical to guide new preventive and treatment strategies for PDAC.

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) manifests aggressive tumor growth and early metastasis. Crucial steps in tumor growth and metastasis are survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and immunosuppression. Previously we have shown that CXCR2 is expressed on endothelial cells, innate immune cells, and fibroblasts and regulates angiogenesis and immune responses. In this report, we examined whether tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of CXCR2-ligands expressing PDAC cells are regulated in vivo by a host CXCR2-dependent mechanism. We generated C57BL6 Cxcr2-/- mice following crosses between Cxcr2-/+ female and Cxcr2-/- male. We orthotopically implanted Cxcr2-ligands expressing KRAS-PDAC cells in the pancreas of wild-type (WT) or Cxcr2-/- C57BL6 mice. No significant difference in PDAC tumor growth was observed. Host Cxcr2 loss led to inhibition in microvessel density in PDAC tumors. Interestingly, an enhanced spontaneous and experimental liver metastasis was observed in Cxcr2-/- mice as compared to WT mice. Increased metastasis in Cxcr2-/- mice was associated with an increase in extramedullary hematopoiesis and expansion of neutrophils and immature myeloid precursor cells in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest a dynamic role of host CXCR2 axis in regulating tumor immune suppression, tumor growth, and metastasis.</p>

A clinicopathological examination focusing on pN0-PC was performed. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Of all 533 patients, 155 (29.1%) were diagnosed with pN0-PC and 378 (70.9%) were diagnosed with node-positive pancreatic cancer (pN1/2-PC).

A multivariate analysis revealed six prognostic factors in pN0-PC: age ≥ 70 years, nonadministration of adjuvant chemotherapy, anterior serosal invasion, nerve plexus invasion, and microscopic lymphatic and venous invasions. The 5-year survival rates of patients who had pN0-PC with 0-1 risk factor, with 2-3 risk factors, and with 4-6 risk factors were 87.6%, 47.9%, and 16.4%, respectively.

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease associated with a poor 5-year overall survival. Most patients are ineligible for surgery due to late diagnosis and are treated primarily with chemotherapy with very limited success. Pancreatic cancer is relatively insensitive to chemotherapy due to multiple factors including reduced bioavailability of drugs to tumor cells. One strategy to improve drug efficacy with reduced toxicity is the development of antibody-drug conjugates which have now been used successfully to treat both solid and liquid tumors. Here we evaluate the efficacy of TR1801-ADC, a newly developed ADC composed of a MET antibody conjugated to the highly potent pyrrolobenzodiazepine toxin-linker Tesirine. Label=“EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We first evaluated MET expression and subcellular localization in pancreatic cancer cell lines, human tumors and patient derived xenografts. We then tested TR1801-ADC efficacy in vitro in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Preclinical evaluation of TR1801-ADC efficacy was conducted on patient derived xenografts selected based on their MET expression level. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We show that MET is highly expressed and located at the plasma membrane of pancreatic cancer cells. We found that TR1801-ADC induces a specific cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cell lines and a profound tumor growth inhibition, even in a gemcitabine resistant tumor. We also noted synergism between TR1801-ADC and gemcitabine in vitro and an improved response to the combination in vivo. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Together these results suggest the promise of agents such as TR1801-ADC as a novel approach to the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality within the next decade, with limited effective treatment options and a dismal long-term prognosis for patients. Genomic profiling has not yet manifested clinical benefits for diagnosis, treatment or prognosis in PDAC, due to the lack of available tissues for sequencing and the confounding effects of low tumour cellularity in many biopsy specimens. Increasing focus is now turning to the use of minimally invasive liquid biopsies to enhance the characterisation of actionable PDAC tumour genomes. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is the most comprehensively studied liquid biopsy analyte in blood and can provide insight into the molecular profile and biological characteristics of individual PDAC tumours, in real-time and in advance of traditional imaging modalities. This can pave the way for identification of new therapeutic targets, novel risk variants and markers of tumour response, to supplement diagnostic screening and provide enhanced scrutiny in treatment stratification. In the roadmap towards the application of precision medicine for clinical management in PDAC, ctDNA analyses may serve a leading role in streamlining candidate biomarkers for clinical integration. In this review, we highlight recent developments in the use of ctDNA-based liquid biopsies for PDAC and provide new insights into the technical, analytical and biological challenges that must be overcome for this potential to be realised.</p>

The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) of &lt; 1 year after surgery for patients who did not die from the surgery. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Tumors were classified as borderline in 78% of cases and locally advanced in 22% of cases. Mean CA19-9 at diagnosis was 934 U/mL, which significantly decreased to 213 U/mL (p &lt; 0.01) after a median of six cycles of FOLFIRINOX. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed most often (76%). The vast majority of patients underwent venous resection (92%), and a simultaneous arterial resection was performed in 16 patients (15%). The severe morbidity rate and 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 21%, 8.5%, and 10.4%, respectively. The median OS after surgery was 23 months. In the multivariate analysis, preoperative CA19-9 ≥ 450 U/mL was the only preoperative factor independently associated with OS of &lt; 1 year (p = 0.044). Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:The preoperative CA19-9 value should be considered in the clinical decision-making process when complex vascular resection is required.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Inflammation is related to the development and progression of pancreatic cancer (PC). Locally, anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2), and systemically, high levels of certain inflammation-modulating cytokines associate with poor prognosis in PC. The detailed effects of systemic inflammation on circulating monocytes and macrophage polarisation remain unknown. We aimed to find out how intracellular signalling of peripheral blood monocytes is affected by the systemic inflammatory state in PC patients and how it affects their differentiation into macrophages. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Monocytes were isolated from 50 consenting PC patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). The phosphorylation status of the signalling molecules was assessed by flow cytometry both from unstimulated and appropriately stimulated monocytes. Monocytes derived from HC and PC patients were co-cultured with cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2 and HPAF-II) in media supplemented with autologous serum, and the CD marker expression of the obtained macrophages was assessed by flow cytometry. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Phosphorylation levels of unstimulated STAT2, STAT3 and STAT6 were higher (p &lt; 0.05) and those of stimulated NF-kB (p = 0.004) and STAT5 (p = 0.006) were lower in patients than in controls. The expression of CD86, a proinflammatory (M1) marker, was higher in control- than patient-derived co-cultured macrophages (p = 0.029). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Circulating monocytes from PC patients showed constitutive phosphorylation and weaker response to stimuli, indicating aberrant activation and immune suppression. When co-culturing the patient-derived monocytes with cancer cells, they differentiated into macrophages with reduced levels of M1 macrophage marker CD86, suggesting compromised anti-tumour features. The results highlight the need for global management of tumour-associated immune aberrations in PC treatment.</p>

<p>Label=“OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Clinical impact of pancreas donor age on pancreas transplantation (PTx) outcome has not been well investigated. Here we analyzed the nationwide PTx registry in Japan to assess posttransplant outcomes in donor age-stratified groups. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:This study included 410 cases of PTx performed in Japan between 2000 and 2019. Analyses were performed using clinical data from the Japan Pancreas Transplant Registry of Japan Society for Pancreas and Islet Transplantation. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:The 410 PTx cases were classified based on donor age: &lt;10 years (n = 10, 2.4%), 10-19 years (n = 30, 7.3%), 20-29 years (n = 64, 15.6%), 30-39 years (n = 75, 18.3%), 40-49 years (n = 114, 27.8%), 50-59 years (n = 90, 22.0%), and ≥60 years (n = 27, 6.6%). The incidence of early pancreas graft loss (8.9%, 36/410 cases) did not exhibit a significant linear correlation with donor age. Posttransplant pancreas graft survival (1-/3-/5-/10-year rates of 85.9%/80.6%/76.2%/67.4% among all cases) was also not significantly associated with donor age. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Pancreas donor age was not significantly associated with posttransplant outcome. This finding supports the use of expanded criteria donors, with regards to pancreas donor age, for PTx in cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Celiac Plexus Neurolysis (EUS-CPN) for the treatment of abdominal pain in pancreatic cancer can be administered in three different ways, depending on the site of needle insertion: central injection (CI), bilateral injection (BI) and celiac ganglia neurolysis (CGN). This meta-analysis aimed to (1) estimate the overall efficacy of the EUS-CPN; (2) compare the efficacy of each of the three techniques; and (3) investigate demographic and disease characteristics as potential predictors of treatment response. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies that reported the proportion of treatment responders to EUS-CPN overall, and according to the technique used. We performed a random effects meta-analysis of proportions, and meta-regression was used to estimate the association between technique and clinical characteristics on treatment response. The safety profile was reviewed through narrative synthesis. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Overall response rate to EUS-CPN was 68% (95% CI 61%-74%) at week two and 53% (95% CI 45%-62%) at week four. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the response rates between the three techniques. Demographics and disease characteristics were not associated with treatment response. Serious complications have been reported for BI and CGN but not for CI. Moderate to high risk of bias was observed. Label=“DISCUSSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:EUS-CPN is a useful adjunct to opioids in the management of pain. There is no evidence of a difference in the efficacy among the three techniques, however, CI is the only one for which serious complications have not been reported. Future research should focus on the appropriate timing of EUS-CPN (early versus on demand) and randomised comparison to establish the comparative efficacy of each technique.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:To investigate the clinical impact of sarcopenia and skeletal muscle density (SMD) among patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent palliative first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:A total of 330 patients treated with first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy between January 2010 and March 2017 were included. CT scans before chemotherapy and after 8±2 weeks were evaluated. The L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) was used to detect sarcopenia and calculated as the total area of the L3 skeletal muscle divided by the height-squared (cm2/m2). SMD was quantified as the mean muscle radiation attenuation of the muscle cross-sectional area across the L3 vertebral body level and was assessed between - 29 and + 150 Hounsfield units. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A SMI to SMD comparison revealed a positive correlation (R2 = 0.058, P &lt; 0.001). Compared with high SMD, the risks of low SMI were 1.516 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.164-1.973) among patients with low SMD. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the low SMD was related to poor overall survival (OS, median, 6.1 versus [vs.] 7.9 months, P = 0.010). Multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that low SMI (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.78, P = 0.032) and low SMD (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.09-1.93, P = 0.011) were poor prognostic factors for OS, respectively. Co-presence of low SMI and low SMD had more powerful prognostic implication for OS (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.12-2.23, P = 0.010). Grade 3 or higher toxicity of chemotherapy was more frequently observed in patients who have a low SMI (43% vs. 59%, P = 0.019) and low SMD (44% vs. 60%, P = 0.023). OS was not related to SMD status among patients who were chemotherapy responders (complete or partial responses). However, among non-responders (stable or progressive disease), low SMD groups had significantly poorer OS in comparison with high SMD groups (median, 5.6 vs 7.4 months, P = 0.006). Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Sarcopenia and SMD status can be considered a prognostic factor in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received palliative first line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Severe chemotherapy toxicity occurred in the sarcopenia and low SMD groups. Our data suggest that a comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle parameters may be more useful prognostic factors.</p>

<p>Label=“INTRODUCTION” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the most dreadful complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and previous literature focused on technical modifications of pancreatic remnant reconstruction. We developed a multifactorial mitigation strategy (MS) and the aim of the study is to assess its clinical impact in patients at high-risk of POPF. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:All patients candidate to PD between 2012 and 2018 were considered. Only patients with a high Fistula Risk Score (FRS 7-10) were included. Patients undergoing MS were compared to patients receiving Standard Strategy (SS). Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Multivariate hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to detect independent predictors of POPF. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Out of 212 patients, 33 were finally included in MS Group and 29 in SS Group. POPF rate was significantly lower in MS Group (12.1% vs 44.8%, p = 0.005). Delayed gastric emptying, postoperative pancreatitis, complications and hospital stay were also significantly lower in MS Group. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses showed that Body Mass Index (OR = 1.196, p = 0.036) and MS (OR = 0.187, p = 0.032) were independently associated with POPF. Label=“CONCLUSION” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:A multifactorial MS can be helpful to reduce POPF rate in patients with high FRS following PD. Personalized approach for vulnerable patients should be investigated in the future.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Acute pancreatitis develops as an inflammatory response to pancreatic tissue injury. Postoperative pancreatitis has recently been associated with increased occurrence of complications. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38 MAPK) pathway occurs early in acute pancreatitis and its inhibition has been suggested to alleviate pancreatic inflammation. Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory steroids whose use in the management of acute pancreatitis remains controversial. Our aim was to examine the effect of crosstalk between pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) and stellate cells (PSCs) on p38 MAPK and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation and to assess the impact of hydrocortisone on these events. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:The long-term co-culture setting for mouse PACs and PSCs developed in our laboratory was used. Parallel 4d mono- and co-cultures with or without 10 nM hydrocortisone were performed followed by immunocytochemical analysis of nuclear GR and phospho-p38 MAPK (pp38 MAPK). Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Hydrocortisone inhibited pp38 MAPK up-regulation evoked by co-culture in PACs and PSCs and increased nuclear translocation of GR in PAC monocultures and in co-cultured PACs and PSCs. In PSC monocultures and co-cultured PACs, ligand-independent expression of nuclear GR was observed. In the former no change in nuclear GR but a significant decrease in total GR as analyzed by Western blot was caused by hydrocortisone. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:Cellular microenvironment plays a significant role on p38 MAPK and GR activation in PACs and PSCs. Hydrocortisone is an effective means to inhibit p38 MAPK activation in PACs and PSCs. Both ligand-dependent and -independent regulatory roles for GR are suggested in the exocrine pancreas.</p>

<p>Well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) arising in the gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary system are the most common neuroendocrine neoplasms. Studies of the molecular basis of these lesions have identified genetic mutations that predispose to familial endocrine neoplasia syndromes and occur both as germline events and in sporadic tumors. The mutations often involve epigenetic regulators rather than the oncogenes and tumor suppressors that are affected in other malignancies. Somatic copy number alterations and miRNAs have also been implicated in the development and progression of some of these tumors. The molecular profiles differ by location, but many are shared by tumors in other sites, including those outside the gastroenteropancreatic system. The approach to therapy relies on both the neuroendocrine nature of these tumors and the identification of specific alterations that can serve as targets for precision oncologic approaches.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND” NlmCategory=“BACKGROUND”:The Memorial Sloan Kettering Prognostic Score (MPS), a composite of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and albumin, is an objective prognostic tool created as a more readily available alternative to the Glasgow Prognostic Score. A prior analysis of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) suggested that the MPS may predict survival, although it did not control for clinically relevant factors. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:MPS scores were calculated for patients with mPDAC treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014. An MPS scale of 0 to 2 was used: 0 for an albumin level ≥ 4 g/dL and an NLR ≤ 4 g/dL, 1 for either an albumin level &lt; 4 g/dL or an NLR &gt; 4 g/dL, and 2 for an albumin level &lt; 4 g/dL and an NLR &gt; 4 g/dL. Performance status, antineoplastic therapy, presence of thromboembolism (TE), radiation therapy, and metastatic sites were also analyzed. The associations with overall survival were examined with time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:A multivariate model revealed that higher MPS scores at diagnosis (hazard ratio for MPS of 2 vs MPS of 0, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.76), liver metastases, radiation therapy, hospital admissions, TE, and performance status were associated with worse overall survival. The median overall survival for patients with MPS scores of 0, 1, and 2 were 12.9, 9.0, and 5.4 months, respectively.

<p>In biosynthesis of the pancreatic cancer drug streptozotocin, the tridomain nonheme-iron oxygenase SznF hydroxylates Nδ and Nω’ of Nω-methyl-l-arginine before oxidatively rearranging the triply modified guanidine to the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea pharmacophore. A previously published structure visualized the monoiron cofactor in the enzyme’s C-terminal cupin domain, which promotes the final rearrangement, but exhibited disorder and minimal metal occupancy in the site of the proposed diiron cofactor in the N-hydroxylating heme-oxygenase-like (HO-like) central domain. We leveraged our recent observation that the N-oxygenating µ-peroxodiiron(III/III) intermediate can form in the HO-like domain after the apo protein self-assembles its diiron(II/II) cofactor to solve structures of SznF with both of its iron cofactors bound. These structures of a biochemically validated member of the emerging heme-oxygenase-like diiron oxidase and oxygenase (HDO) superfamily with intact diiron cofactor reveal both the large-scale conformational change required to assemble the O2-reactive Fe2(II/II) complex and the structural basis for cofactor instability-a trait shared by the other validated HDOs. During cofactor (dis)assembly, a ligand-harboring core helix dynamically (un)folds. The diiron cofactor also coordinates an unanticipated Glu ligand contributed by an auxiliary helix implicated in substrate binding by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The additional carboxylate ligand is conserved in another N-oxygenating HDO but not in two HDOs that cleave carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds to install olefins. Among ∼9,600 sequences identified bioinformatically as members of the emerging HDO superfamily, ∼25% conserve this additional carboxylate residue and are thus tentatively assigned as N-oxygenases.</p>

It is unclear, however, whether patients who had received irinotecan derive benefit. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Medical records of metastatic pancreas cancer patients who had received irinotecan and then Nal-IRI were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival after the initiation of Nal-IRI (an a priori threshold of &gt;4 months defined success); adverse events and quotes from the medical record on decision-making were also recorded. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Sixty four patients met eligibility criteria with a median age of 65 years (range: 36, 80 years). The median overall survival from initiation of Nal-IRI was 5.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.3, 5.6 months). An exploratory comparison, based on no cancer progression with irinotecan versus progression, showed improved survival with Nal-IRI in the former group: 6.1 months (95% CI: 5.1, 9.3 months) versus 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.3, 4.8 months); p = 0.0006. Nal-IRI adverse events occurred as expected. Qualitative data illustrate several themes, including “limited treatment options,” which appeared to drive the decision to prescribe Nal-IRI.

<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) is a tumor suppressor in many cancers. However, its roles and action mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. Here, we analyzed MAP2K4 and its downstream kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) using immunohistochemical staining and their prognostic significances using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in our PDAC cohort. Then, we validated MAP2K4/JNK/p38 mRNA levels and prognostic significances using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Finally, we evaluated the effects of MAP2K4 on the proliferation and invasion of PDAC cells. MAP2K4, JNK, and p38 proteins were expressed in 97.3 % (72/74), 95.6 % (65/68), and 88.6 % (62/70) of the samples, respectively, and their levels in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in normal ducts. MAP2K4 protein expression was lower in male patients (p = 0.028). In our PDAC cohort, advanced TNM stage, low MAP2K4, and high JNK protein levels were significant prognostic factors for poor overall survival (OS) based on a univariate survival analysis (p = 0.006, p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). N stage and MAP2K4 and JNK protein levels were independent prognostic factors for OS based on multivariate analysis. We then built a prognosis prediction nomogram combining the standard TNM staging system with MAP2K4 and JNK expression that had a Harrell’s C-index of 0.645. The new prognosis prediction model effectively stratified the resected patients with PDAC, from both our cohort and TCGA database, into low- and high-risk groups. Finally, MAP2K4 overexpression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro. This study shows that reduced protein and mRNA levels of MAP2K4 found in PDAC patients, coupled to in vitro effects observed, support the tumor suppressor role of MAP2K4 in PDAC.

<p>Among pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms, gastric, intestinal, and pancreatobiliary intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN), and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) have been defined, differing regarding association with invasive carcinoma and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help in the distinction of these neoplasms, but a proportion is unclassifiable using recommended markers. Hence, additional markers useful for the typing of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms are needed. The reported frequencies of the different types of IPMNs in surgical series vary to some extent, and such data based on Danish patients are currently lacking. Besides, the role of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in these neoplasms has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of different types of pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms in a Danish cohort. Furthermore, we aimed to examine the utility of CD117, CK17, CK20, MUC4, and villin as markers for their distinction, in addition to the recommended markers MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6 and CDX2, and to evaluate the frequency of MMR deficiency. We typed 40 consecutively resected pancreatic intraductal papillary neoplasms according to the WHO criteria from 2019. IHC for CD117, CDX2, CK17, CK20, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUC1 (H23), MUC1 (Ma695), MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, PMS2, and villin was performed and evaluated using a five-tiered semiquantitative scale. A subset of the tumours was examined with PCR for microsatellite instability (MSI). Most tumours were intestinal (40 %) and gastric (40 %) IPMNs, followed by pancreatobiliary (17 %) IPMNs and IOPN (3 %). All cases were MMR proficient. We found a higher expression of MUC4, CK20 and villin in intestinal compared to gastric IPMNs (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001). MUC4 was more strongly expressed in intestinal compared to pancreatobiliary IPMNs, while the opposite was found for CK17 (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05).

<p>Label=“PURPOSE” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:Cyclin and MAPK/MEK-related gene alterations are implicated in cell-cycle progression and cancer growth. Yet, monotherapy to target the cyclin (CDK4/6) or the MEK pathway has often yielded disappointing results. Because co-alterations in cyclin and MEK pathway genes frequently co-occur, we hypothesized that resistance to CDK4/6 or MEK inhibitor monotherapy might be mediated via activation of oncogenic co-drivers, and that combination therapy might be useful. Label=“PATIENTS AND METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Herein, we describe nine patients with advanced malignancies harboring concomitant CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B alterations (up-regulate CDK4/6) along with KRAS or BRAF alterations (activate the MEK pathway) who were treated with palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) combination-based regimens. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Two patients (with pancreatic cancer) achieved a partial remission (PR) and, overall, five patients (56%) had clinical benefit (stable disease {greater than or equal to}6 months/PR) with progression-free survival of ~7, 9, 9, 11, and 17.5+ months. Interestingly, one of these patients whose cancer (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) had progressed on MEK targeting did well for about one year after palbociclib was added. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:These observations suggest that co-targeting cyclin and MEK signaling can be successful when tumors bear genomic co-alterations that activate both of these pathways. Further prospective studies using this matching precision strategy in order to overcome resistance are warranted.</p>

<p>Autoimmune diabetes is one of the complications resulting from checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in cancer patients, yet the underlying mechanisms for such an adverse effect are not well understood. Leveraging the diabetes-susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, we phenocopy the diabetes progression induced by programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade and identify a cascade of highly interdependent cellular interactions involving diabetogenic CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages. We demonstrate that exhausted CD8 T cells are the major cells that respond to PD-1 blockade producing high levels of IFN-γ. Most importantly, the activated T cells lead to the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages that become highly activated when responding to IFN-γ. These macrophages acquire cytocidal activity against β-cells via nitric oxide and induce autoimmune diabetes. Collectively, the data in this study reveal a critical role of macrophages in the PD-1 blockade-induced diabetogenesis, providing new insights for the understanding of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in cancer and infectious diseases.</p>

<p>Complete surgical resection, most often associated with perioperative chemotherapy, is the only way to offer a chance of cure for patients with pancreatic cancer. One of the most important factors in determining survival outcome that can be influenced by the surgeon is the R0 resection. However, the proximity of mesenteric vessels in cephalic pancreatic tumors, especially the mesenterico-portal venous axis, results in an increased risk of vein involvement and/or the presence of malignant cells in the venous bed margin. A concomitant venous resection can be performed to decrease the risk of a positive margin. Given the additional technical difficulty that this implies, many surgeons seek a path between the tumor and the vein, hoping for the absence of tumor infiltration into the perivascular tissue on pathologic analysis, particularly in cases with administration of neoadjuvant therapy. The definition of optimal surgical margin remains a subject of debate, but at least 1 mm is an independent predictor of survival after pancreatic cancer surgical resection. Although preoperative radiologic assessment is essential for accurate planning of a pancreatic resection, intraoperative decision-making with regard to resection of the mesenterico-portal vein in tumors with a venous contact remains unclear and variable. Although venous histologic involvement and perivascular infiltration are not accurately predictable preoperatively, clinicians must examine the existing criteria and normograms to guide their surgical management according to the integration of new imaging techniques, preoperative chemotherapy use, tumor biology and molecular histopathology, and surgical techniques.</p>

Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:We show here that CEACAM7 is expressed in a large subset of PDAC tumors, with low to undetectable expression in all normal tissues tested. CEACAM7 is also expressed in primary PDAC cultures isolated from patient-derived tumors, with high expression within the cancer stem cell-enriched subset. CAR T cells targeting CEACAM7 are capable of targeting antigen-expressing tumor cells, and mediate remission in patient-derived xenograft tumors.

<p>Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) not only show cytoprotective role and their involvement in the development of anticancer drug resistance, but also transmit signals that control cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of GST isoforms in chemotherapy resistance remains elusive in pancreatic cancer. Here, we demonstrated that gemcitabine treatment increased the GSTM2 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GSTM2 by siRNA elevated apoptosis and decreased viability of pancreatic cancer cells treated with gemcitabine. Moreover, in vivo experiments further showed that shRNA induced GSTM2 downregulation enhanced drug sensitivity of gemcitabine in orthotopic pancreatic tumor mice. We also found that GSTM2 levels were lower in tumor tissues than in non-tumor tissues and higher GSTM2 expression was significantly associated with longer overall survival. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GSTM2 expression is essential for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells undergoing gemcitabine treatment and leads to chemo resistance. Downregulation of GSTM2 in pancreatic cancer may benefit gemcitabine treatment. GSTM2 expression in patients also shows significant correlation with overall survival.

Thus, our study suggests that GSTM2 is a potential target for chemotherapy optimization and prognostic biomarker of pancreatic cancer.</p>

ERCP was more common in those with obstructed pancreatic duct (p = 0.0009), pancreas divisum (p = 0.0009), prior pancreatic surgery (p = 0.005), and longer disease duration (p = 0.004). A greater number of ERCPs was associated with disease duration (p &lt; 0.0001), obstructed pancreatic duct (p = 0.006), and prior pancreatic surgery (p = 0.006) and increased risk for positive islet culture (p &lt; 0.0001). Mean total IEQ/kg with vs. without prior ERCP were 4145 (95% CI 3621-4669) vs. 3476 (95% CI 2521-4431) respectively (p = 0.23). Adjusting for confounders, islet yield was not significantly associated with prior ERCP, number of ERCPs, biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy or stent placement. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:ERCP did not appear to adversely impact islet yield. When indicated, ERCP need not be withheld to optimize islet yield but the risk-benefit ratio of ERCP should be considered given its potential harms, including risk for excessive delay in TPIAT.</p>

We recently reported a genetically engineered adult mouse model where Cdkn2b downregulation was required together with Cdkn2a downregulation to inactivate the Rb pathway. Besides, the role of Smad4, which is mutated more frequently than Cdkn2b in human pancreatic cancer, was determined critical on the development of the pancreas tumor by some reports. However, the impact of Smad4 deficiency in combination with PDAC-relevant mutations, such as Cdkn2a when induced in adult pancreas has not been completely elucidated in mice. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:Lentiviral delivered oncogene/tumor suppressors in adult pancreas. The development of pancreatic cancer was monitored. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunofluorescence were performed for pathological identification of the pancreatic cancer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to test gene expression. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:Loss of Smad4 could cooperate with alterations of KRAS, Trp53, and Cdkn2a to induce pancreatic cancer in adult mice. The role of Smad4 was mainly in downregulating the expression of Cdkn2b and further inducing phosphorylation of the Rb1 protein. Label=“CONCLUSIONS” NlmCategory=“CONCLUSIONS”:These findings show an essential role of Smad4 deficiency in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) formation. This model better recapitulates the adult onset, clonal origin, and genetic alterations in human PDAC and can be simply generated on a large-scale.</p>

<p>Label=“BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS” NlmCategory=“OBJECTIVE”:There is substantial interest in liquid biopsy approaches for cancer early detection, among subjects at risk, using multi-marker panels. CA19-9 is an established circulating biomarker for pancreatic cancer. However, its relevance for pancreatic cancer early detection or for monitoring subjects at risk has not been established. Label=“METHODS” NlmCategory=“METHODS”:CA19-9 levels were assessed in blinded sera from 175 subjects collected up to 5 years prior to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and from 875 matched controls from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. For comparison of performance, CA19-9 was assayed in blinded independent sets of samples collected at diagnosis from 129 subjects with resectable pancreatic cancer and 275 controls (100 healthy subjects; 50 with chronic pancreatitis; and 125 with non-cancerous pancreatic cysts). The complementary value of two additional protein markers, TIMP1 and LRG1, was determined. Label=“RESULTS” NlmCategory=“RESULTS”:In the PLCO cohort, levels of CA19-9 increased exponentially starting at two years prior to diagnosis with sensitivities reaching 60% at 99% specificity within 0-6 months prior to diagnosis for all cases and 50% at 99% specificity for cases diagnosed with early-stage disease. Performance was comparable for distinguishing newly diagnosed cases with resectable pancreatic cancer from healthy controls (64% sensitivity at 99% specificity). Comparison of resectable pancreatic cancer cases to subjects with chronic pancreatitis yielded 46% sensitivity at 99% specificity and for subjects with non-cancerous cysts 30% sensitivity at 99% specificity. For pre-diagnostic cases below cut-off value for CA19-9, the combination with LRG1 and TIMP1 yielded an increment of 13.2% in sensitivity at 99% specificity (p=0.031) in identifying cases diagnosed within 1 year of blood collection.
